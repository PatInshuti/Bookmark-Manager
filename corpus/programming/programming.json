Computer abbreviations, Error, Programming terms Automata-based programming Automata-based programming is a computer programming paradigm that treats sections of the program as finite automata. Each automaton can take one 'step' at a time, and the execution of the program is broken down into individual steps. The steps communicate with each other by changing the value of a variable representing 'the state,' and control flow of the program is determined by the value of that variable. The 'state' variable can be a simple enum data type, but more complex data structures may be used. A common technique is to create a state transition table, a two-dimensional array comprising rows representing every possible state, and columns representing input parameter. The value of the table where the row and column meet is the next state the machine should transition to if both conditions are met.

Programming terms ActiveX ActiveX is an extension to Microsoft's OLE and COM technologies used in applications and on the Internet. Using ActiveX, an Internet browser can interact with your computer more than what is available through HTML. For example, ActiveX allows users to scan their computer for viruses in their browser using free online antivirus scanners or scan their computer for any Windows updates. Although there are benefits to using ActiveX, because it can interface outside the browser there are also various security threats and malware that can attack the computer using ActiveX. Therefore, unless you know what the ActiveX plug-in does and you trust the website that is asking to install the ActiveX plug-in we recommend not installing any ActiveX plug-ins. Microsoft Internet Explorer is the only Internet browser that uses ActiveX, although many alternative browsers do have ActiveX plug-ins that can be installed. Browsers that do not support ActiveX use alternative plug-ins such as Flash, Java, and Shockwave. Related pages How do I know what websites I can trust?

Alternatively referred to as addition, add is a math operation that takes two or more different numbers and outputs their total value. An example of addition is 10 + 4 = 14. On a computer, you can add numbers using a calculator program and the addition symbol. Addition operator In many programming languages, the addition operator ( += ) can be used as a way to add to a previous value. For example, in the Perl code below, the $example variable is first set to a value of '2'. The next line uses the addition operator to add '2' to the variable. $example = 2; $example += 2; print 'Total = $example '; When the script above is executed, the computer would print out 'Total = 4' to the screen.

Data, Internet terms, Network terms, Programming terms Agile development methods In the software development process, Agile development methods are a set of procedures that dictate the ways in which multiple teams of developers collaborate on a project. The term 'agile software development' was introduced in 2001 in a document known as the Agile manifesto. Development projects that use agile software development focus on adapting to the changing nature of goals rather than predicting ahead of time what those goals will be. They do this by employing an iterative process in which goals are re-evaluated as necessary to move the project forward. The Agile Manifesto outlines the underlying concepts of agile development, which are stated as: 'We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Responding to change over following a plan. ...That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.' Collaboration, Programming terms, Software development Assembly language Sometimes referred to as assembly or ASM, an assembly language is a low-level programming language. Programs written in assembly languages are compiled by an assembler. Every assembler has its own assembly language, which is designed for one specific computer architecture. Why is ASM useful? Machine language is a series of numbers, which is not easy for humans to read. Using ASM, programmers can write human-readable programs that correspond almost exactly to machine language. The disadvantage is that everything the computer does must be described explicitly, in precise detail. The advantage is that the programmer has maximum control over what the computer is doing. Why is ASM a 'low-level' language? Assembly is called a low-level programming language because there is (nearly) a one-to-one relationship between what it tells the computer to do, and what the computer does. In general, one line of an assembly program contains a maximum of one instruction for the computer. How is ASM different from a 'high-level' language? High-level languages provide abstractions of low-level operations which allow the programmer to focus more on describing what they want to do, and less on how it should be done. Programming this way is more convenient and makes programs easier to read at the sacrifice of low-level control. Programs written in high-level languages will never match the raw speed and efficiency of programs written in assembly. Examples of high-level languages include Python, Java, JavaScript, Clojure, and Lisp. What is a 'mid-level' language? Mid-level or lower-level languages provide some high-level abstractions to make the programmer's life easier, while still providing access to low-level operations. They are often used to write operating systems, so they are sometimes called system programming languages. Programs written in mid-level languages can perform as well, or nearly as well, as programs written in assembly language. Examples of mid-level programming languages include C, C++, Ada, Nim, and Rust. Is ASM portable? No. Because assembly languages are tied to one specific computer architecture, they are not portable. A program written in one assembly language would need to be completely rewritten for it to run on another type of machine. Portability is one of the main advantages of higher-level languages. The C programming language is often called 'portable assembly' because C compilers exist for nearly every modern system architecture. A program written in C may require some changes before it will compile on another computer, but the core language is portable. Generally speaking, the higher-level a language is, the fewer changes need to be made for it to run on another architecture. The lowest-level languages — machine language and assembly language — are not portable. Example: Hello, World! in 32-bit assembly, for Windows Here is 'Hello, World' written for a 32-bit Intel processor. It will also run on a 64-bit processor. We will compile and run it on Windows 10. global _main extern _printf section .text _main: push message call _printf add esp, 4 ret message: db 'Hello, World!', 10, 0 To begin, open Notepad. Copy and paste the code above into a new text file, and save the file as hello.asm. To compile the assembly, we will use NASM, the Netwide Assembler. It can be downloaded at https://www.nasm.us/. nasm -f win32 hello.asm When you run this command, NASM creates an object file. An object file contains machine code, but is not quite an executable file. Our object file is called hello.obj. To create the executable, we will use the 32-bit version of MinGW (Minimal GNU for Windows) which will provide the gcc compiler. It can be downloaded at http://www.mingw.org/. gcc -o hello.exe hello.obj hello Hello, World! Example: Hello, World! in 64-bit assembly, for Linux Here is 'Hello, World' written for a 64-bit Intel processor. We will compile and run it on 64-bit Linux. extern printf ; the C printf function, to be called section .data ; Data section, initialized variables msg: db 'Hello, world!', 0 ; C string terminates with 0 fmt: db '%s', 10, 0 ; The printf format, ' ','0' section .text ; Begin code section global main ; the standard gcc entry point main: ; the program label for the entry point push rbp ; set up stack frame, must be aligned mov rdi,fmt mov rsi,msg mov rax,0 ; can also be: xor rax,rax call printf ; Call C printf function pop rbp ; restore stack mov rax,0 ; normal, no error, return value ret ; return Copy and paste this program into a new file called hello.asm. Then, compile the assembly with NASM, which you can install with your package manager. For instance, on Ubuntu or Debian, you can install NASM using apt: sudo apt update && sudo apt install nasm Run this command to create your object file: nasm -f elf64 hello.asm The object file is named hello.o. Next, use gcc to link this object file to the necessary libraries on your computer, and compile it to an executable file called hello: gcc hello.o -o hello Lastly, run the executable file: ./hello Hello, world! For reference, this is the same program, written in C: #include <stdio.h> int main()   char msg[  = 'Hello world '; printf('%s ',msg); return 0;   Related ASM pages See debugging routines for other examples of low-level assembly code and additional information about what each routine does.

In JavaScript, an alert is a type of 'pop-up' message to users of a script. An alert could be anything from notifying the user of an error to saying a short phrase such as 'Hi'. A JavaScript alert looks similar to the example shown in the picture. This alert can be produced by using the JavaScript code shown below. <script type='text/javascript'> window.alert('This is an alert!'); </script> Since the window object is a top-level object in JavaScript (when coding for web browsers), this code can be shortened to alert() rather than window.alert(), as shown in the example below. <script type='text/javascript'> alert('This is an alert!'); </script> Tip With HTML5, you no longer need to specify the type of script. In other words, the attribute type='text/javascript' is no longer required. JavaScript alerts, when misused, can be an annoyance to the website visitor. However, they can also be useful for giving the user information such as instructions for fixing errors in a form field. They can also be helpful to JavaScript programmers as a means of debugging a script. By using an alert message to display values, the programmer can determine where things may be going wrong in a script through the process of elimination. 2. In general, an alert box, also called an alert dialog or alert window. It is a small window that pops up providing information to the user with an OK button, and sometimes a Cancel button. Error messages and general information are commonly displayed in alert boxes, as it calls attention to itself and makes the user click a button to hide the message. The Windows operating system, along with third-party applications, and web pages are sources for alert boxes. Dialog box, Programming terms ALGOL Formerly known as IAL, ALGOL is short for algorithmic language. It is a family of portable programming languages for scientific computations that had a strong influence on other languages. Additionally, ALGOL was used as the standard method for creating algorithms by the ACM in textbooks and academia for over 30 years. Major ALGOL specifications ALGOL 58 - introduced in 1958 ALGOL 60 - introduced in 1960 ALGOL 68 - revised in 1973 Computer abbreviations, Programming terms, Thunk Algorithm Derived from the name of the mathematician Muhammed ibn-Musa Al-Khowarizmi, an algorithm is a solution to a problem that meets the following criteria. A list of instructions, procedures, or formula that solves a problem. Can be proven. Something that always finishes and works. Examples of how algorithms are used today Today, algorithms are used billions of times every day for a variety of tasks. Below are a few of the different ways algorithms are used today. Algorithms help control traffic lights. Computers use algorithms to convert data (e.g., converting decimal into binary). Google search uses the PageRank algorithm to sort search results. Encryption to encrypt and decrypt information and keep data safe is an algorithm. GPS uses algorithms to find the best route to a destination. There are dozens of sort algorithms that are used to sort data. Smartphones, Wi-Fi, and wireless communication use algorithms to communicate. E-mail spam detection uses algorithms to filter out bad e-mails. Data compression for getting information faster (e.g., YouTube video) use algorithms. When was the first algorithm? Because a cooking recipe could be considered an algorithm the first algorithm could go back as far as when writing. However, many find Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor to be the first. This algorithm that was first described in 300 B.C. Ada Lovelace, who is credited to be the first computer programmer and the first person to develop an algorithm for a machine.

In computers, any limited resource may be allocated, such as RAM and disk space. Memory allocation Before software can use your computer's RAM, it requests a memory allocation from the operating system. The operating system attempts to accommodate the request, based on factors including how much memory is being used by other software. If not enough memory can be allocated, the software may not be able to run. Disk allocation Before a non-volatile storage device such as a hard disk or SSD can be used, some or all its available space must be allocated. The allocation is performed by disk management software, such as your operating system installer, Windows Disk Management, fdisk, or GParted. The allocation is called a partition. Any space on your disk that has not been partitioned is called unallocated. Memory allocation in computer programming Each computer programming language offers its own approach to memory management. The C programming language requires that the developer explicitly allocate and free memory used by a C program. The Python programming language manages memory automatically, which makes the developer's life easier, at the expense of performance. Like C, the C++ programming language permits for explicitly managed memory, but also provides optional memory management features such as GC (garbage collection).

For example, in an outdoor scene, the sky is considered the source of ambient light. So, any given point in the scene may be assigned a value according to how exposed it is to the sky. More specifically, if you were traveling through a tunnel, the entrance would be more exposed to the ambient light of the sky, but deeper parts of the tunnel would be darker, or more occluded. 3D, Programming terms AOP AOP may refer to any of the following: 1.

Examples include + (addition operator), - (subtraction operator), * (multiplication operator), and / (division operator). Operator, Programming terms Array of pointers In computer programming, an array of pointers is an indexed set of variables in which the variables are pointers (a reference to a location in memory). Pointers are an important tool in computer science for creating, using, and destroying all types of data structures. An array of pointers is useful for the same reason that all arrays are useful: it allows you to numerically index a large set of variables. Below is an array of pointers in C that sets each pointer in one array to point to an integer in another and then print the values of the integers by dereferencing the pointers. In other words, this code prints the value in memory of where the pointers point. #include <stdio.h> const int ARRAY_SIZE = 5; int main ()     first, declare and set an array of five integers: */ int array_of_integers[  =  5, 10, 20, 40, 80 ;   next, declare an array of five pointers-to-integers: */ int i, *array_of_pointers[ARRAY_SIZE ; for ( i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++)     for indices 1 through 5, set a pointer to point to a corresponding integer: */ array_of_pointers[i  = &array_of_integers[i ;   for ( i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++)     print the values of the integers pointed to by the pointers: */ printf('array_of_integers[%d  = %d ', i, *array_of_pointers[i  );   return 0;   The output of the above program is: array_of_integers[0  = 5 array_of_integers[1  = 10 array_of_integers[2  = 20 array_of_integers[3  = 40 array_of_integers[4  = 80 Array, Computer Science, Memory, Pointer, Programming terms Array An array may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to programming, an array is a group of related data values (called elements) that are grouped together. All the array elements must be the same data type. The examples below show how an array is defined and called in Perl and JavaScript. Perl array example As you can see in the example below, our array is called '@numbers' and it contains a set of different numerical values that are spelled out. my @numbers = ('one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'); print '$numbers[0  and $number[1  equals 3'; The above Perl script prints the first two elements in this array by using $numbers[0  (0 always being the first number in programming) and $number[1 , followed by the 'equals 3' text (result in the box below). one and two equals 3 Tip When you call elements from an array by their element number, that number is referred to as a subscript. JavaScript array example The below JavaScript array example utilizes the same array name and values as the Perl array example above. function myFunc()  var numbers = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five' ; numbers.toString(); document.getElementById('example').innerHTML = numbers[0  + ' and ' + numbers[1  + ' equals 3';   The above JavaScript code prints the first two elements in this array by using numbers[0  (0 always being the first value in a JavaScript array) and number[1 , followed by the 'equals 3' text (result in the box below). one and two equals 3 The above JavaScript example assumes there is an HTML element with the ID of 'example', such as <p id='example'> or <div id='example'>, where the text is displayed. Note The 'myFunc()' function is called as a page load event (e.g., <body onload='myFunction()'>), a button click event (e.g., <button onclick='myFunction()'>Try it</button>), or other event. 2. With computer drives, an array is two or more drives that are grouped together and act as one drive.

Answer set programming, also known as ASP, is a declarative programming paradigm that is used to solve NP-hard computing problems. It reduces extremely difficult problems into simplified, stable problem models, and attempts to solve them using specialized programs known as answer set solvers. A good example of an answer set programming language is AnsProlog, which is a specialized version of Prolog that avoids infinite loops when solving extremely difficult problems.

ASPI has become a de facto standard for programmers that want to create drivers that work with all ASPI-compatible SCSI adapters. Computer acronyms, Hardware terms, Programming terms Assembler Program used to convert or translate programs written in assembly code to machine code. Some users may also refer to assembly language or assembler language as assembler. Assembly language, Compile, Machine language, Programming terms Associative operation An associative operation may refer to any of the following: 1. In mathematics, an associative operation is a calculation that gives the same result regardless of the way the numbers are grouped. Addition and multiplication are both associative, while subtraction and division are not. For example, take a look at the calculations below. Associative 2+(2+5) = 9 (2+2)+5 = 9 Not associative 4-(2-1) = 3 (4-2)-1 = 1 In the additional examples, it does not matter the order the numbers are added. Whether adding 2+5 first and then adding 2, or adding 2+2 first and then adding 5, the result is 9 and makes it associative. On the other hand, the subtraction is not associative since changing the grouping changes the result. 2. In programming, an associative operation occurs when no grouping is present, where operators that have the same precedence, or will be evaluated either from left to right or vice versa. If neither of these is the case in the programming language, then it will either be a special operator or it gives a syntax error, as a result. For example, addition and subtraction have the same precedence and are left-associative. Thus, if there is no grouping with parentheses, the operators are evaluated from left to right. For example, 4-3+1 equals 2, since 4-3 is calculated first, with the result being added to 1. To change this order, the programmer needs to group the numbers to calculate the expression as desired. If the programmer wants to perform the 3+1 calculation first, it can be grouped using parentheses, as shown below. 4-(3+1) This forces 3+1 to be calculated first, with the result (4) subtracted from 4, giving zero. With most languages, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators are left-associative, while the assignment, conditional, and exponentiation operators are right associative. Operator, Programming terms AutoHotkey AutoHotkey is a fantastic free and open source Microsoft Windows tool that allows you to create macros, scripts, and automate frequently performed tasks on your computer. For example, Computer Hope uses this tool daily to help answer common questions asked in e-mail quickly and perform other common repetitive tasks. Below are a few examples of what AutoHotkey is capable of doing. AutoHotkey capabilities Create a script or macro that is executed using shortcut keys, hotkeys, joystick, and even mouse clicks. Create keywords (hotstring) that expand abbreviations or type out any frequently used response. Create custom data-entry forms, user interfaces, and menu bars. Create hotkeys for keyboard, joystick, and mouse. Virtually any key, button, or combination can become a hotkey. Convert any script into an EXE file that can be run on computers that don't have AutoHotkey installed. Automation, Programming terms, Script Automated unit testing Automated unit testing is a method of testing software. Units (small sections) of the code are rigorously checked to ensure they work correctly. A separate program can be written specifically to test the unit, using every reasonable piece of data the code might encounter in real-world use. The goal of automated unit testing is to demonstrate that each part of a larger software development project works as intended. Automated unit tests may also aid in documenting the software's functionality. Developers who did not write the code, but want to understand how it works, can view the results of a unit test to gain insight into how the code interfaces with the systems where it runs. Developers may also see how the code interacts with the end users who provide it with input and other units that are part of the same software package. Preventive maintenance, Programming terms, Software development, Test Automation The process of incorporating many tasks into one is referred to as automation. For example, a user may develop a Perl script to parse through a text log file of a website's traffic and generate an HTML report of that website's traffic. In this example, this would take a person several hours or days to complete, but could be automated and completed in a few seconds or minutes and could be scheduled to be done daily. AutoHotkey, Batch file, Programming terms, Script, Software terms Babel Babel is a general-purpose programming language first released in 2014. It is designed to write programs that are meant to conserve system resources and battery life on target devices. Programs written in Babel are cross-platform, garbage-collected, and can be rapidly prototyped using a built-in REPL (read-evaluate-print loop) debugger. The syntax of Babel is similar to LISP, but with several key differences. For example, Babel statements are enclosed in parentheses but use postfix notion for operations (the operator appears after the operands). Hello, World! in Babel Hello, World! may be written in Babel as: ((main  'Hello, world ' <<  )) Related pages Programming language history. Cross-platform, Hello world, Language, Programming terms, Resource Back-end A back-end may refer to any of the following: 1. In general, a back-end task or operation is one that is performed in the background, without a user's awareness or direct interaction. 2. In programming and development, the back-end is a term that describes a person who designs and develops programs and scripts that process data and perform tasks the user doesn't see. For example, a website's back-end developer is responsible for how the server sends information to visitors. In contrast, a front-end developer is responsible for how that information is presented, and how users may interact with it. Background, Front end, Programming terms, TSR Back-face culling Back-face culling is a method in computer graphics programming which determines whether a polygon of a graphical object is visible. If not visible, the polygon is 'culled' from rendering process, which increases efficiency by reducing the number of polygons that the hardware has to draw. The vertices of front-facing polygons wind in a clockwise fashion, so polygons that face away from the camera are in a counter-clockwise order relative to the current view. When back-faces are culled, these polygons are not drawn. Note The process is similar to clipping, which determines if polygons are in the camera's field of view at all, and if not, are not rendered. Computer graphic, Programming terms Background thread In programming, a background thread is a thread that runs behind the scenes, while the foreground thread continues to run. For instance, a background thread may perform calculations on user input while the user is entering information using a foreground thread. Background, Programming terms Base address When referring to computer memory, the base address is a memory starting point that address that references all other memory addresses. Absolute address, Memory address, Memory terms, Offset, Programming terms Batch file A batch file may refer to any of the following: 1. A batch file or batch job is a collection, or list, of commands that are processed in sequence often without requiring user input or intervention. With a computer running a Microsoft operating system such as Windows, a batch file is stored as a file with a .bat file extension. Other operating systems may define a batch job in a shell script, containing a list of commands to be executed one after the other. Batch files are often used to help load programs, run multiple processes at a time, and perform common or repetitive tasks. For example, a batch job could be used to back up files, process log files, run a series of calculations or diagnostics, or any other job that require multiple commands to be run. A big advantage of a batch job is that it can be started at any time and left alone until they are completed, freeing up the time of one or more people to perform other tasks. 2. The batch command is a Recovery Console command that executes a series of commands. See the batch command page for full information on this command. Autoexec.bat, Operating system terms, Programming terms BCPL Short for Basic Combined Programming Language, BCPL is a programming language developed in 1966 by Martin Richards of the University of Cambridge. It quickly became popular, largely because of its high portability. BCPL is the successor to the CPL programming language, the first language to print the infamous 'Hello World!' test message, and the first programming language used to create a MUD.

Computer abbreviations, CPL, Programming language, Programming terms BeanShell BeanShell is an open source Java source interpreter first created by Patrick Niemeyer in 1999. BeanShell was written in Java and includes scripting language features such as loose types, commands, and closures similar to JavaScript and Perl. It can be used for numerous purposes, such as user scripting extension, testing, configuration, dynamic deployment, and more. BeanShell can run in four modes: command line, console, applet, and remote session server. Its scripting features include method closures, event handlers, error reporting, and more. Related pages Official BeanShell website: http://www.beanshell.org Interpreter, Programming language, Programming terms Binary search A binary search, also known as a half-interval search, is an algorithm used in computer science to locate a specified value (key) within an array. For the search to be binary, the array must be sorted in either ascending or descending order. How does it work? As you can see in the diagram, at each step of the algorithm a comparison is made, and the procedure branches into one of two directions. Specifically, the key value is compared to the middle element of the array. If the key value is less than or greater than this middle element, the algorithm knows which half of the array to continue searching in because the array is sorted. This process is repeated on progressively smaller segments of the array until the value is located. Because each step in the algorithm divides the array size in half, a binary search will complete successfully in logarithmic time. That is to say, the worst-case scenario for an array of n elements is guaranteed to be within log(n) operations. Binary, Programming terms, Search Bind Bind may refer to any of the following: 1. In computer programming, to bind is to create a connection between two or more programming objects for a specified amount of time. 2. In computer networking, bind allows a resource to be sent or received. For example, one may bind a request to TCP/IP indicating that it is ready to receive or send information. Related pages Computer network and network card help and support. 3. In IBM's System Network Architecture, to bind is to set up a session between two logical units or network end points before communicating. 4. When referring to the computer keyboard or gaming, a binding or key binding refers to assigning an action to a single key. For example, a player could bind their keyboard spacebar to shoot a gun in a game, however, another player may have their spacebar key bound to jump their character. Key bindings are usually found within a game's options or controls. Related pages Computer keyboard help and support. 5. BIND is also short for Berkeley Internet Name Domain and is a popular name DNS (domain name system) server software originally designed for BSD. 6. When referring to a shell, bind is a builtin command of the Bash shell. See our bind command page for further information. 7. In an MMO game, bind may also refer to a bind point. Computer abbreviations, Game terms, Network terms, Programming terms Bit shift A bit shift is a bitwise operation in which the order of a series of bits is moved, either to the left or the right, to efficiently perform a mathematical operation. Bit shifts help with optimization in low-level programming because they require fewer calculations for the CPU than conventional math. Bit shifting operations may be declared explicitly by the programmer, or automatically by the compiler if it can identify that such an optimization is possible. As an example, consider the integer 23, represented with eight bits: 00010111 If we shift all the bits left one place, discard the leftmost bit, and insert a zero on the right, the result is the binary representation of 46: 00101110 This action is effectively the same as multiplying the number by two. Programming terms Bitwise operators Bitwise operators are used in programming for operating on the individual bits of binary values. For example, one of the binary operators is the NOT operator. It performs an unary negation on each bit within a binary value (effectively changing all zeroes to ones and ones to zeroes). For example, NOT 010 would return 101. The syntax for using bitwise operators is different among the various programming languages, so programmers need to refer to the documentation for the language being used. Boolean, Programming terms Block-level element In HTML programming, a block-level element is any element that starts on a new line, like a paragraph, and takes up the full width of a page, from left to right. A block-level element can take up one line or multiple lines and has a line break before and after the element. Examples of a block-level elements <address> - Shows contact information. <applet> - Embed a Java applet. <article> - Contains the article's content. <aside> - Describe a section of content. <blockquote> - Denote a section that is quoted. <canvas> - Draw graphics using JavaScript. <caption> - Add caption to table. <center> - Center text. <details> - Create an interactive widget to hide text. <dir> - Designate a collection of file names. <div> - Creates a document division. <dl> - Contain a list of definitions and their descriptions. <dt> - Designate a term within a description list. <embed> - Designate an area for interactive content. <figure> - Designate an area of self-contained content <form> - Creates an input form to capture data. <frame> - Create a frame window of another page. <h1> to <h6> - Creates a heading. <header> - Create a header section. <hr> - Create a horizontal line. <iframe> - Create a window frame of a page. <li> - Used to denote a list item. <main> - Contains the content specific to a certain page. <marquee> - Create scrolling text. <nav> - Contains a page's navigations links. <noscript> - Contains the content to use in browsers that don't support scripting. <object> - Designate an object embedded into a web page <ol> - Contains an ordered list. <p> - Used to denote a paragraph. <pre> - Contains preformatted text. <section> - Group thematically similar content together. <table> - Contains a table. <ul> - Contains an unordered list. Tip Formatting, or styles, for a block-level element can be applied using CSS, assigning classes to different styles. Browser, CSS, Format, Programming terms, Style Block A block may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to a hard drive or other storage devices, a block is a segment of a large area that can be assigned to store data. 2. With a text cursor, a block cursor is a cursor that indicates text will be overwritten. See our insert key definition for further information on this cursor and how text insertion can be changed. 3. When referring to a radio frequency or spectrum, a block is a subset range of radio frequencies in a larger band. 4. In computer programming, a code block is a group of declarations and statements which operates as a unit, usually with its own level of lexical scope. For instance, a block of code may be used to define a function, a conditional statement, or a loop. Below is an example of a conditional statement structured as a code block. if (question == answered)   print('Computer Hope');   5. In general, block is a term used to describe anything that is restricted. For example, a parent may block a website from being visited so their children are not exposed to anything they shouldn't be seeing. Related pages How do I block a website? Band, Block indent, Block of text, Burst, Hard drive terms, Memory terms, Phone terms, Programming terms, Super block Backpropagation neural network A backpropagation neural network is a way to train neural networks. It involves providing a neural network with a set of input values for which the correct output value is known beforehand. The network processes the input and produces an output value, which is compared to the correct value. If the result is incorrect, gradual changes are propagated backward through the network, and the calculation is made again. This process repeats until the desired output is calculated by the network. Neural network, Programming terms BOM BOM may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for byte order mark, BOM is another name for the Unicode character at the beginning of a file that indicates whether or not a file is UTF-16 or UTF-32. 2. Short for bill of materials, BOM is a complete listing of everything that makes up a product. For example, a computer purchased from a computer manufacturer has a BOM of every part or a purchasable parts. A BOM contains the name of the part, it's part number, and the quantity of parts. 3. Short for beginning of medium, BOM is a string of characters that mark the beginning of a medium such as a tape drive. 4. Short for beginning of message, BOM is a signal or string of characters that indicate a message is starting. Business terms, Computer abbreviations, EOF, Programming terms, Tape drive terms, Unicode, UTF Boolean Developed by the English mathematician and computer pioneer George Boole, a Boolean, bool, or Boolean expression is a value that is either TRUE or FALSE. Tip Boolean is pronounced bool-e-an. Boolean operator examples A boolean operator, or logical operator, consists of operators such as AND, OR, NOT, NOR, NAND, and XOR. These operators are used with conditional statements in programming, search engines, algorithms, and formulas. Below is an example chart that helps explain the Boolean operations even more by detailing each of the different Boolean situations. Example data = 'Computer Hope is a location to find free computer help and information.' Boolean Value_1 Value_2 Explanation Results AND Free Help Because the above example data contains both 'free' and 'help' the results would be TRUE. TRUE AND Expensive Help Although the above example does have 'help,' it does not contain 'expensive,' which makes the result FALSE. FALSE OR Free Help The above example data has both 'free' and 'help,' but the OR Boolean only requires one or the other, which makes this TRUE. TRUE OR Expensive Help Although 'expensive' is not in the example data, it still does contain 'help,' which makes the TRUE. TRUE NOT Free The above example does contain 'free,' which makes the result FALSE. FALSE NOT Expensive The above example does not contain 'expensive,' which makes the result TRUE. TRUE XOR Free Help The above example contains both 'free' and 'help,' the XOR Boolean only requires one or the other, but not both, making this FALSE. FALSE XOR Expensive Help The above example does not contain 'expensive' but does contain 'help,' which makes this TRUE. TRUE For a detailed explanation of how each of these operations works in hardware and software, see our logic operations overview. What is a boolean data type? In computer science, a boolean data type is any data type that has either a true or false value, yes or no value, or on or off (1 or 0) value. By default, the boolean data type is set to false. In some programming languages, such as Perl, there is no special boolean data type. However, when using if it will return as either true or false. Booleans used in programming In programming, a boolean can be used with conditional statements (i.e. if statement), as shown in the following example using Perl. use strict; my ($name, $password); print ' Name: '; chomp($name = <STDIN>); print ' Password: '; chomp($password = <STDIN>); if (($name eq 'bob') && ($password eq 'example'))   print 'Success ';   else   print 'Fail '; die;   As you can see, the if statement is looking for a username that is equal to 'bob' and a password that is equal to 'example'. If either the name or password is not correct, the program prints 'Fail' and terminates. Ampersand, Bitwise operators, Conditional statement, Data type, False, Operator, Programming terms, True, XOR Bracket Sometimes referred to as square brackets, a bracket is a punctuation mark found in pairs. There are two types of brackets: the open bracket ( [ ) and the closed bracket (   ). The open bracket has an open end towards the right, and the closed bracket has an open end towards the left. Brackets are the two keys found to the right of the P key on a US QWERTY keyboard. Where are the square bracket keys on the keyboard? Below is an overview of a computer keyboard with the open square bracket and close bracket keys highlighted in blue. How to create an open and close square bracket Creating the '[' and ' ' symbols on a U.S. keyboard On English keyboards, the open bracket and close bracket are on the same key as the curly bracket keys close to the Enter key. Note Pressing and holding the Shift key while pressing the square bracket key creates a curly bracket. Creating the '[' and ' ' symbol on a smartphone or tablet To create an open and close bracket a smartphone or tablet open the keyboard and go into the numbers (123) and then (#+=) or symbols (sym) section and then press your finger on the '[' or ' ' symbol. How are brackets used? Basic textual manner to add additional or missing details ('It was a honor to do it [the presentation .') Regular expressions, wildcards, SQL, Visual Basic, C#, and JavaScript programming languages to enclose characters for string validation, pattern matching, or build arrays. Used in standard mathematical notation for intervals and floor functions, as well as in the Lie bracket and Iverson bracket. Regular expression bracket example $value = s/[a-z /-/ig; This example replaces any character 'a' through 'z' in the $value variable with a hyphen. JavaScript programming bracket example var myList = new Array(); myList[0  = 'value1'; myList[1  = 'value2'; myList[2  = 'value3'; SQL programming bracket example SELECT name FROM customers WHERE name LIKE '[M-Z inger' Curly bracket, Keyboard terms, Programming terms, SSD mounting bracket Branch With revision control or versions, a branch is an alternate version of the main project or trunk. Branches are often used to experiment, help develop new features, or for special situations like giving one customer a special ability or fix. Master, Programming terms, Trunk Brooks Brooks is an experimental, multi-paradigm programming language that was proposed by Petra Hofstedt in 2003. It is a 'functional logic' language that 'bring[s  together deterministic computations from the functional world and nondeterministic search operations from the logic world.' Its name is a homage to the logician Haskell Brooks Curry. Haskell, Logic, Paradigm, Programming terms Bug tracking Bug tracking, also known as issue tracking, is a part of the software development process. Bug tracking utilizes a separate, dedicated piece of software to keep track of reported bugs and fully document their diagnosis and resolution. When software is in development, it is tested before being released by a QA department. If it is found to operate incorrectly, the behavior is reported to the issue tracking system. All information associated with that bug is then kept in a centralized location accessible to the project team. Bug tracking software can continue to track software issues after the software is released so that bugs may be eliminated in future updates. Programming terms, Software development Bug A bug is a general term used to describe any unexpected problem with hardware or software. For example, Grace Hopper logged and taped a moth bug in a log book, as shown below, that caused issues with the Mark II after it was discovered in one of its components. Grace Hopper's moth is often considered the first use of the term bug. However, there are other earlier accounts of a bug being used to describe a problem with electrical circuits and hardware. As complex as computers, hardware, and computer software is today, there is no such thing as bug-free software or hardware. When bugs are discovered, software bugs are fixed by running software patches and resolvable hardware bugs are fixed with firmware updates and drivers. In the case of more serious hardware bugs, the resolution may be to replace the hardware device. The time it takes to resolve a bug depends on how complex a problem is that relates to the bug, how many developers are working on the problem, and how much time they're given. If you believe you've found a bug in a program or device, reporting the bug to the manufacturer is the best way of getting the bug resolved. What is the difference between an error and bug? An error is a message shown to the user of a program, and a bug is a problem in the code that is causing the error to be shown. See our error page for a full explanation and examples of computer errors. Bug bounty, Bugfairy, Bug tracking, Debug, Error, Exploit, Flaw, Glitch, Patch, Problem, Programming terms, Vulnerability, Y2K Bugfairy A bugfairy is slang used to describe an individual who brings or reports a bug or error to a developer. Bug, Programming terms Bytecode Alternatively referred to as intermediate code, bytecode is compiled programming code that targets a virtual machine rather than a specific computer architecture. Bytecode allows a single compiled binary to run, and perform with almost native efficiency, on a diverse array of platforms. Examples In Java, bytecode compilation is used to 'compile once, run anywhere.' Compiled Java programs will run on any computer that has a Java virtual machine installed. Languages that compile to bytecode include the following. Programming terms C C may refer to any of the following: 1. C is commonly used to describe the C: drive or the first hard drive on IBM compatible computers. 2. The C programming language is a high-level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan at Bell Labs in 1972 from an almost unknown language named B. The first major program written in C was the Unix operating system, and for many years, C was considered to be inextricably linked with Unix. Below is an example of a C program that prints 'Hello World!' after it's been compiled. If you need a free C compiler, consider GCC. The picture is an example of The C Programming Language book by Kernighan and Ritchie that is also sometimes referred to as the bible. #include <stdio.h> main()   printf ('Hello World! ');   3. C is an abbreviation for Celsius. 4. C represents the scientific unit for the coulomb. 5. The C button on calculators is short for 'clear' and is a button used to clear all last numbers and totals. Calculators that have this key may also have a CE button that is used to only clear the last entered number. For example, if several numbers have been entered before the number you're entering now, you can press the CE button only to clear the current number without deleting any prior numbers. If you wanted to clear everything, you could press the C button instead. 6. Shorthand for see or sea. For example, someone may say 'ICU' in chat as a short method of typing 'I see you.' C++, Celsius, GCC, High-level language, Procedural language, Programming languages, Programming terms Callback A callback may refer to any of the following: 1. A security feature that verifies the dial-in user is whom they say they are by calling the person back. After the callback and the username, password, and any other information are verified, they are granted access. 2. A callback is also another name for a returned phone call. 3. In computer programming, a callback is a function, procedure, or method, which is passed as an argument to another function. The callback is then called later when the appropriate conditions are met. Callbacks are often lambda functions, and are a characteristic component of many programming paradigms including event-based programming. Phone terms, Programming terms, Security terms Camel book Camel book is a nickname given to the O'Reilly series of books written about the programming language Perl. Each of these books has a picture of a Camel on the front of the book, as shown in the picture. Note The camel books only cover the Perl programming language; they are not related to the programming languages Caml and OCaml. Related pages What computer books would you recommend reading? Perl, Programming terms CamelCase Alternatively referred to as bicapitalisation, medial capitals, and Pascal case, the term CamelCase describes a compound word which uses capital letters to delimit the word parts. The name refers to the internal capital letters, which resemble the humps on a camel's back. For example, ComputerHope, FedEx, and WordPerfect are all examples of CamelCase. In computer programming CamelCase is often used as a naming convention for naming variables, arrays, and other elements. For example, $MyVariable is an example of a variable that uses CamelCase. Converting text into CamelCase can be as simple as using a singular regular expression, as shown in the below Perl example. my $camelcase = 'This is a test.'; $camelcase =~ s/ ([a-z )/ u$1/g; The above example, would convert the text 'This is a test.' into 'ThisIsATest.' Use the below conversion tool to convert any text into CamelCase and other forms of converted text. Conversion Tool: Pascal, Programming terms, Underscore Captured variable A captured variable is a variable captured in programming code via the use of a closure. Programming terms, Variable CC CC may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for carbon copy or courtesy copy, CC is a copy of an e-mail to be shared but requires no reply or action. For example, it is not uncommon for an employee who is sending an important message to other employees to also CC their manager or boss to help keep them up-to-date. For anyone not familiar with the term 'Carbon Copy,' this term is derived from carbon paper that allows you to make a copy of another piece of paper. For example, if you have ever written a check the piece of paper behind the check is a carbon copy of the check that makes a duplicate copy of the check. What should I put in an e-mail CC field? Unless you plan on sending a carbon copy of the e-mail to someone else, the CC field can be left blank. Do I reply to an e-mail if I'm in the CC field? Generally speaking, no, you should not reply to an e-mail if you're e-mail address is in the CC field. Your e-mail address should only be in the CC field because the original sender wants to keep you in the loop of what is being discussed in the e-mail but does not require a reply. Tip If you want everyone to respond to an e-mail keep their address in the To field, which supports multiple e-mail addresses. 2. When referring to the mouse or mouse cursor, CC is short for Cursor Control. Cursor Control describes the ability to move the cursor using the arrow keys. 3. When referring to a Linux and Unix command, cc is a C compiler command. For additional information about the cc command, see our Linux and Unix cc command guide. 4. CC is an abbreviation for Creative Commons. 5. With a shortcut, C-c refers to the Ctrl+C shortcut key. BCC, Computer acronyms, E-mail, E-mail terms, Internet terms, Message body, Programming terms, Subject CGI CGI may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for common gateway interface, CGI allows visitors to a web page to send and receive information from a server. A common example of how a CGI script is used is by allowing a user to type a set of keywords, pass those to a CGI application to process a search, and then return results to the web page. Often, CGI scripts (e.g., Perl script) and executables are run through cgi-bin directory. 2. Short for computer generated imagery, CGI is any image or sequence of images that have been generated with the aid of computers. CGI is commonly used in movies to generate the simulated, realistic looking images or animated objects, commonly referred to as special effects. The 1976 movie Futureworld was the first feature film to use 3D computer generated images. The following simple image was generated using computer software. After effects, Computer acronyms, Loony bin, Programming terms, Server, SFX, Web design terms Chaos model The chaos model is an approach to the software development process that uses ideas from chaos theory to address common issues while working in a team setting. It endeavors to unify the best programming methodologies with the best project management techniques; ideally forming an overall superior strategy. The chaos model's relationship to chaos theory is the idea that large-scale architectural issues cannot be stabilized without also stabilizing the 'smaller' issues in the software. Including the individual lines of code. Software development The chaos model focuses on defining, implementing, and integrating the life cycles of the various smaller aspects of a software development project, on the following levels: The project as a whole. The various interconnected systems being developed. The various modular aspects of the software. The software's functions. The individual lines of code. Chaos model strategy The strategy of the chaos model is to identify pertinent issues and 'always resolve the most important issue first' according to the following definitions: An issue is an incomplete programming task. The most important issue is a combination of big, urgent, and robust: big issues are those which provide value to users in the form of functionality; urgent issues are those which will hold up other work until they are resolved; robust issues are those that are trusted and tested when resolved. An issue is resolved when it is brought to a point of stability. Programming terms Char The abbreviation char is used as a reserved keyword in some programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, and Java. It is short for character, which is a data type that holds one character (letter, number, etc.) of data. For example, the value of a char variable could be any one-character value, such as 'A', '4', or '#'. Also, other languages that do not have char as a data type may use the abbreviation for certain methods that are used with string values. For example, JavaScript has methods such as charAt() and charCodeAt() that return values pertaining to the calling string. The charAt() method, for instance, returns a string containing one character, which is the character at the location given as a parameter to the function. Running the following code would alert the value of the character at position 2 in the string 'computer hope' (starts from 0 rather than 1): mystring = 'computer hope'; window.alert(mystring.charAt(2)); The above code would send an alert with the text m, because 'c' is at the 0 position, 'o' is at the 1 position, and 'm' is at the 2 position. Character, Computer abbreviations, Programming terms Character code Alternatively referred to as the character set, charset, and character encoding, a character code describes a specific encoding for characters as defined in the code page. Each character code defines how the bits in a stream of text are mapped to the characters they represent. ASCII is the basis of most code pages; for example, the value for a character 'C' is represented by 67 in ASCII. ASCII, Character, EBCDIC, Programming terms, Typography terms, Unicode Class A class may refer to any of the following: 1. With object-oriented programming, this term refers to a set of related objects that share common characteristics. Classes and the ability to create new classes are what make object-oriented programming a powerful and flexible programming model. 2. With CSS, a class is a selector used to specify a style on an HTML element. For example, the below class called center could be created to center text on a paragraph of text. CSS class code .center   text-align: center;   HTML <p> tag with center class <p class='center'>This text would be centered.</p> As can be seen in the above CSS code, every CSS class needs a period in front of the name of the class to be defined as a class. A line that does not begin with a period is considered an HTML tag selector and an id selector begins with a #. Note Never start a CSS class with a number since not all browsers support class names beginning with numbers. 3. With an IP address, a class is a section or group of IP addresses. See our IP definition for a listing of each of the IP classes. 4. In a game, a class is a character based on abilities. For example, a warrior and mage are both examples of game classes; a warrior is often strong can withstand lots of damage, but does not deal lots of damage and a mage is the complete opposite.

Java, Programming terms Clojure Clojure is a dialect of the Lisp programming language that focuses on concurrent computing. It was created by Rich Hickey, who released the first version of the programming language in 2007. He wanted to create a modern version of Lisp that focused on the functional programming of multi-threaded programs, and was also compatible with Java environments. To this end, Clojure provides many built-in tools for using immutable objects, and it runs on the Java virtual machine. 'Hello, World!' written in Clojure (println 'Hello, world!')

Computer acronyms, Programming language, Programming terms Closure A closure is a programming technique that allows variables outside of the scope of a function to be accessed. In many cases, a closure is created when a function is defined in another function, allowing the inner function to access variables in the outer function. Captured variable, Programming terms CLR The common language runtime, also known as the CLR, is a virtual machine used as part of Microsoft's .NET framework. It takes CIL (common intermediate language) code — bytecode from compiled C#, VB.NET or other .NET source code — and converts it to machine native code. The CLR uses just-in-time compilation to execute the compiled code of .NET applications regardless of what programming language was used. In doing so, it ensures proper memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, system security, and thread management. Tip Additional information on CLR is on the Common Language Runtime site from Microsoft.

Apple, Distributed computing, Programming terms, Software Code refactoring Code refactoring is a technique in software development by which modifications are made to a program's source code without modifying its external appearance or behavior to the user. It is performed to make improvements in the way the code is structured, bring legacy code up-to-date, as well as improve the code's legibility, compatibility, and re-usability. Programming terms Code Code may refer to any of the following: 1. Code, which can be short for source code, is a term used to describe text that is written using the protocol of a particular language by a computer programmer. Examples include C, Java, Perl, and PHP. Code can also be used in a less formal fashion to refer to text written for markup or styling languages like HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). For example, you may see people make reference to code in numerous languages, such as 'C code,' 'PHP code,' 'HTML code,' or 'CSS code.' 2. When writing in HTML, the <code> tag is used to designate that a section of text is computer code. 3. When describing a hardware identification number a code may refer to a serial number or model number. With software a code may refer to the activation code. Codename, Computer abbreviations, Programming terms, Source code Code page A code page is a page that contains a list of character codes and their corresponding glyphs (character). For example, with code page 437 (uses with most English versions of Windows) the character code 160 is an 'a' with an accent (á). For computers that are using code page 437 holding down the Alt on the keyboard and then entering '160' on the numeric keypad. How to determine what code page my computer is using MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows command line users can use the chcp command to determine what code page the computer is currently using. The chcp command can also be used to change the code page. See the chcp command page for further information and examples on this command. Alt, ASCII, Character code, Programming terms, Unicode CoffeeScript CoffeeScript is a multi-paradigm programming language that may be converted into JavaScript when it is compiled. This ability allows developers to create JavaScript programs as their final product, but to write the programs in a language that uses a more convenient and robust syntax. CoffeeScript facilitates both imperative and functional programming styles, and can be used as a scripting language. Its syntax incorporates some of the most popular elements of Ruby, Haskell, and Python. For example, it uses whitespace to define code blocks, much like Python. Since its official release in 2010, CoffeeScript has become extremely influential. Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, has referenced it as an example of the future direction that JavaScript should take. At some large software development organizations such as Dropbox, CoffeeScript has replaced JavaScript completely. Related pages The official CoffeeScript website is https://coffeescript.org. Developer, Paradigm, Programming terms Command language Sometimes referred to as a command script, a command language is a language used for executing a series of commands that would otherwise be executed at the prompt. A good example of a command language is Microsoft Windows batch files. Although command languages are useful for executing a series of commands, their functionality is limited to what is available at the command line which can make them easier to learn. Below is a basic example of a Microsoft Windows batch file that deletes all the files in the Windows temp directory. REM Delete Windows temp files. echo Deleting Windows temp files. cd window temp del *.* /q Below is a basic example of a Perl script that could be run in Microsoft Windows that performs a similar task to the above batch file example, but with some more sophistication. In this example, this script not only deletes the files, but creates a log containing information about each file deleted. # Delete Windows files and log results into log.txt my (@files, $files); my ($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday, $yday, $isdst, $timeoffset); ($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday, $yday, $isdst) = localtime; $year = $year + 1900; @files = `dir /b c: windows temp`; open(mylog, '>>log.txt') || print 'ERROR: $!'; foreach $files (@files)   $files =~ s/ //g; system('del c :  windows  temp  $files /q'); print 'Deleting $files at $hour:$min:$sec on $mon/$mday/$year '; print mylog 'Deleting $files at $hour:$min:$sec on $mon/$mday/$year ';   close(mylog); Advantages of command languages Very easy for all types of users to write. Do not require the files to be compiled. Easy to modify and make additional commands. Very small files. Do not require any additional programs or files that are not already found on the operating system. Disadvantages of command languages Can be limited when comparing with other programming languages or scripting languages. May not execute as fast as other languages or compiled programs. Some command languages often offer little more than using the commands available for the operating system used. In conclusion, scripts, and command languages are very similar. However, scripts or programs offer the user the ability to perform many more than commands that would otherwise be executed at the prompt. Command, Language, Programming terms, Script Comment A comment may refer to any of the following: 1. A comment is any text in a program's code, script, or another file that is not meant to be seen by the user running the program. However, is seen when viewing the source code. Comments help make code easier to understand by explaining what is happening and can help prevent portions of a program from executing. In the image is an example of an HTML comment. See our nonexecutable statement page for a full definition and further examples of comments in programming. 2. Hidden text in Microsoft Excel that enables users to make comments about cells and their values. 3. In general, a comment is a remark, suggestion, or another form of feedback about a product or service. If you would like to give Computer Hope a comment, contact customer service. Business terms, Feedback, Nonexecutable statement, Pod, Programming terms, Remark Commutative operation In math, an operation is commutative if the order of the numbers used can be altered with the result remaining the same. For example, addition and multiplication are commutative operations, as shown below. 2+3 = 5 3+2 = 5 2*3 = 6 3*2 = 6 In contrast, subtraction and division are not commutative, because changing the order of the numbers involved will change the result of the calculation, as shown below. 2-7 = -5 7-2 = 5 3/4 = 0.75 4/3 = 1.3333333 In programming, this can be used with the logical AND or the logical OR operations to 'short circuit' if a particular condition is met, so that other possibilities need not be tested. For example, with the AND operation, if the first condition is false, then the whole comparison must return false, so the remaining conditions are not evaluated. For example, a null value in JavaScript would create an error if it is used. A logical statement could be used to indicate if a value is null, then the remainder of the statement is not executed. var x = 0; if ( (y !== null) && (y > 0) && (y < 3) )   window.alert(y * 4);   In this case, if y is null, then the remainder of the statement is not executed. That prevents any errors with a null y variable and keeps additional processing from being done if y is null. Programming terms Compilation Compilation is the process the computer takes to convert a high-level programming language into a machine language that the computer can understand. The software which performs this conversion is called a compiler. High-level language, Machine language, Programming terms Compile Compile is the process of creating an executable program from code written in a compiled programming language. Compiling allows the computer to run and understand the program without the need of the programming software used to create it. When a program is compiled it is often compiled for a specific platform (e.g., IBM platform) that works with IBM compatible computers, but not other platforms (e.g., Apple platform). The first compiler was developed by Grace Hopper while working on the Harvard Mark I computer. Today, most high-level languages will include their own compiler or have toolkits available that can be used to compile the program. A good example of a compiler used with Java is Eclipse and an example of a compiler used with C and C++ is the gcc command. Depending on how big the program is it should take a few seconds or minutes to compile and if no errors are encountered while being compiled an executable file is created. Tip Scripting languages like Perl and PHP do not need to be compiled and use an interpreter to run. What is compile time? The compile time is the total time it takes a compiler to compile code into a program that can be run by the computer. A-0, AOP, Assemble, Binaries, Compilation, Intermediate language, Interpreted language, JIT compiler, LLVM, One-pass compiler, Programming terms, Recompile, Transcompiler Computer instructions Computer instructions may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to the computer processor, an instruction is a segment of code that contains steps that need to be executed by the computer processor. For a computer to do something, instructions have to be given to the computer processor so it knows how to do what it is being asked to do. For example, if you were to ask the computer to draw a square, it would need a set of instructions on how to draw the square, so it can complete the task. In Logo, a user could complete this task by giving the computer the below set of instructions. The picture to the right is an example of the results. forward 100 right 90 forward 100 right 90 forward 100 right 90 forward 100 How does a computer get instructions? A computer is given instructions by a human using a keyboard or another input device. To interpret these instructions, the computer uses an operating system or software that is also programmed by a human to translate the user commands into something the computer can understand. 2. Computer instructions are a set of steps or documentation that includes information on how to operate, perform, or otherwise maintain particular computer software or hardware. If a program or hardware device includes an instruction manual or online instructions, it is highly recommended that these be reviewed before asking questions. 3. Instructions are also a portion of programming that prompts a computer to execute a function. These instructions are stored on the hard disk drive or another storage device and are not executed until they are run by the user.

At the quantum level, properties that exhibit complementarity include an object's position and momentum, wave nature and particle nature, and axial spin. It is closely related to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: the more accurately one of these properties is measured, the less accurately it is possible to measure the other. Complementarity has profound implication in quantum computing, which uses these properties of matter at the quantum level to perform mathematical operations. Programming terms, Quantum Computer science Sometimes abbreviated as CS or CompSci, computer science is the study of computers, how they work and basic skills in computer programming. Anyone with a computer science degree has a good understanding of computer software and hardware, as well as a skill in one or more computer programming languages. How do I learn computer science? The programming part of computer science is certainly something that can be self-taught. However, unless you can teach yourself high-level math, such as calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra, you'll need to attend a university. What are jobs that are available for a computer science student? Someone with a computer science degree often gets a job where they become a programmer and help to create computer software or write scripts. However, once you have a computer science degree, you are capable of working at and applying for most computer-related jobs. Computer acronyms, Degree, Programming terms, Theoretical computer science Compute Compute may refer to any of the following: 1. The term compute can have multiple meanings, but the basic meaning is the act of calculating a value using mathematical formulas or other methods. A computer processes many functions by computing information, which in its simplest form, is a series of ones and zeroes (called binary code). The computer got its name due to this. Compute is used in multiple other forms, but still to refer to the same basic function of calculating, or determining, information. People sometimes make the comment 'does not compute' in a joking manner, to mean something does not make sense, or they cannot come up with an answer to a question. Robotic characters in movies and television shows have made similar comments that mean the same thing. 2. Compute may also refer to a computer magazine titled 'Compute!' that was published from 1979 to 1994, which focused on the computer system and all the major platforms at the time. 3. Compute is also a common misspelling for 'computer.' Computer Concurrency Concurrency may refer to any of the following: 1. Concurrency is the occurrence of multiple events within overlapping time frames, but not simultaneously. On a computer system, concurrency is implemented in the paradigm called concurrent computing. The three main types of concurrent computing are threading, asynchrony, and preemptive multitasking. Each method has its own special precautions which must be taken to prevent race conditions, in which multiple threads or processes access the same shared data in memory in improper order. Tip For in-depth information about concurrent programming, see the Apple developer guide, Concurrency Programming: An Introduction. 2. When working with databases, concurrency controls are used to make sure each transaction on the database takes place in a particular order rather than at the same time. This keeps the transactions from working at the same time, which could cause data to become incorrect or corrupt the database. For instance, if two transactions are attempting to write data into the same column or row of a database table and they write to it at the same time, one or both entries could be lost. Concurrency controls ensure that each transaction is processed one after the other, so that the data is entered properly. Database terms, Programming terms Constant Const or constant is a term used to describe data or a value that does not change in a specified amount of time, unlike a variable. For example, in a PHP script, when a constant is defined, it will remain the same throughout the script. Below is an example of how you'd define and use a constant. define ('EXAMPLE', 'There is hope! '); echo 'Is there hope? ', EXAMPLE; Entering the code above would return 'Is there hope? There is hope!' in a PHP page. Tip It's common and preferred that constants be created in all uppercase. Programming terms, Read-only, Static, Variable Constructor chaining In object-oriented programming, constructor chaining is the technique of creating an instance of a class with multiple constructors, then using one constructor to call another. The primary use of constructor chaining is to make a program simpler, with fewer repeated lines of code. How does it work? In a language like Java, a class can be thought of as a template for structured data, in which all characteristics and actions defined generally. An instance of the class is a specific data structure with unique values in this defined structure. Normally, a class has a special method that shares the exact name as the class itself. This method, called a constructor, will be executed automatically when a new instance of the class is created. Using ad hoc polymorphism, multiple constructor methods can share the same name and call each other, giving the programmer more options as to how an instance might be created. Related pages How do I create a computer program? Object-oriented, Polymorphism, Programming terms Constructor A constructor may refer to any of the following: 1. In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a method or function that is used for the special purpose of creating an instance of the class to which it belongs. It has no return value and is usually identified by having the same name as the class itself. For instance, in Java, a class named 'Animal' may have a constructor method also named 'Animal' that is run automatically any time a new 'Animal' object is created. 2. Constructor is a video game first released in 1997 for computers running the MS-DOS and Windows in which the player controls a construction company. 3. Constructor is also specialized version of the CAD software ArchiCAD that contains tools for building 3D models of large-scale construction projects. Object-oriented, Programming terms, Software terms, Value Content migration The process of moving structured data to a new system is referred to as content migration. Most commonly, it refers to moving the content stored in one CMS (content management system) to another. Its purpose in usually to reorganize or consolidate content to allow for greater control by the content provider and a more unified look and feel for the content consumer. The process may be as simple as importing information from a database, or as complex as copying and re-writing portions to make it compatible with a new set of templates. Programming terms Control flow In computer programming, control flow or flow of control is the order function calls, instructions, and statements are executed or evaluated when a program is running. Many programming languages have what are called control flow statements, which are used to determine what section of code is run in a program at any time. An example of a control flow statement is an if/else statement, shown in the following JavaScript example. var x = 1; if (x === 1)   window.alert('x is equal to 1.');   else   window.alert('x is not equal to 1.');   In this example, if the variable x is set equal to 1, then the code in the curly brackets    after the 'if' statement is executed. Otherwise, the code in the curly brackets after the 'else' statement is executed. This code works to control the flow of the program, depending on the value of the variable x. Note: Control flow and flow control are different terms, not to be used interchangeably. Execute, Goto, If statement, Label, Programming terms, Subroutine Conditional statement Alternatively referred to as a conditional expression and conditional processing, a conditional statement is a set of rules performed if a certain condition is met. It is sometimes referred to as an If-Then statement, because IF a condition is met, THEN an action is performed. For example, consider the following textual example of a conditional statement. IF a value is less than 10, THEN display the words 'Value is less than 10' on the screen. The example above is how a conditional statement might be interpreted by the human brain. Using a computer programming language, the conditional statement above could be written like the example statements below. if ($myval < 10)   print 'Value is less than 10';   In this example, if the variable $myval is less than 10, the software program prints 'Value is less than 10' to the screen. if ($myval == 10)   print 'The value equals 10';   else   print 'Value is not equal to 10';   In this example, if the variable is exactly equal to 10, it will print 'The value equals 10' to the screen. Otherwise, it will print 'Myval is not equal to 10' to the screen. if ($myval > 10)   print 'Value is greater than 10';   elsif ($myval < 10)   print 'Value is less than 10';   else   print 'The value equals 10';   Finally, this last example will print one of three messages to the screen, depending if the value is greater than 10, less than 10, or equal to 10.

Later this programming language was replaced with BCPL. 2. The .cpl is a computer file extension for the Windows Control Panel icons. For example, entering sysdm.cpl from the Windows Run box opens the System Properties window. BCPL, Computer abbreviations, Programming language, Programming terms C++ C++ is a high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs beginning in 1979. The original title of C++ was 'C with classes.' While he was a graduate student, Stroustrup was frustrated that available languages offered him either fast performance or high-level features for program organization, but not both. This inspired him to write his own programming language. He set out to create a programming language that compiles to lean, efficient code, but also provides high-level abstractions to better manage large development projects. The language was later named 'C++,' a tongue-in-cheek reference to ++, an operator in C that increments a value by 1. Since then, C++ has become one of the most widely-used languages in the world, especially in projects where performance comes at a premium. C++ continues to be updated and maintained; the current version is C++ 11, released in 2011. Features The syntax of C++ is largely inherited from the C language. It adds object-oriented programming features to its predecessor, such as classes, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also provides functionality for function and operator overloading, generic programming facilities (such as the ability to create templates), and exception handling. C++ also features and a robust STL (standard library) of useful data structures, algorithms, and input/output facilities. Hello, World! in C++ Here is an example 'Hello, World!' program written in C++, using the I/O stream facility; part of the C++ STL. #include <iostream> int main()   std::cout << 'Hello, world!

Programming terms CSS compressor In web design, changes to a page's appearance are primarily accomplished through the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). As the code for a CSS file is written, the developer undoubtedly adds some unnecessary characters like comments, or whitespace and newline characters. A CSS compressor is any software capable of removing these extra characters from the CSS file, while still maintaining full functionality. CSS compressors can be found built into web development programs and online. Where can I find a CSS compressor? The following websites offer free CSS file compressors. Comment, CSS editor, Developer, Programming terms, White space CSS editor In web design, changes to a page's appearance are primarily accomplished through the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). A CSS editor is any software capable of editing a CSS file. In fact, even the most basic text editor included with your operating system (Notepad for Windows and TextEdit for macOS) can write and manipulate CSS files. More advanced CSS editors off additional features such as live preview and syntax highlighting. CSS compressor, Live preview, Operating system, Programming terms, Software, Text editor, Web design CSS CSS may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for cascading style sheets, CSS is a language used to describe reusable styles for presenting documents written in a markup language. Its concept was originated by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994. In December 1996, CSS was made a specification by the W3C and today allows web developers to alter the layout and appearance of their web pages. For example, CSS may be used to change the font used in certain HTML element, as well as its size and color. A single CSS file may be linked to multiple pages, which allows a developer to change the appearance of all the pages at the same time. The following box contains a basic example of using CSS code to define fonts, the color of hyperlinks, and the color of a link when the mouse cursor hovers over it. In this specific example, we are only changing the HTML tags <a> and <body>, rather than creating any new class or id selectors. body   font: normal 100% 'trebuchet ms', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;   a   color: #000000;   A:visited   color: #005177;   a:hover   color: #005177;   The CSS code in the box above can be inserted into the head section of a page's HTML using the following code. However, keep in mind that performing this action only applies these changes to a single page. <style type='text/css'> <!-- above code inserted here --> </style> If you want to use the CSS code on multiple pages, we suggest storing the code in a separate CSS file and then loading it on every page. For example, the CSS code shown in the first box on this page can be copied and pasted into a file with the .css file extension. Tip A CSS file can be created using any text editor or even Notepad if you're using Windows. After the file is saved, it must linked to in the head of the HTML code using the <link> tag. The following box shows an example of this element in use. <link rel='stylesheet' Type='text/css' href='URL or path to css file here'> If you named the file example.css, and it was in the same directory as the HTML file it is being loaded for, the following would link it. <link rel='stylesheet' Type='text/css' href='example.css'> CSS3 is the version of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that replaces CSS2. It introduces new selectors and properties that allow for more flexibility with page layout and presentation. Some updates, such as the box-shadow property (which allows a drop shadow to be added to an element), allow visual effects to be applied without the need for creating special images. Is CSS a markup language? No. CSS is a style sheet language that gives appearance changes to a markup language. For example, HTML is used to create the basic layout of a web page such as this paragraph of text. CSS is used to define the font, font size, font weight, its position, and other visual settings. 2. Short for Content Scramble System, CSS is a protection scheme used to help protect copyrighted material stored on DVDs from being copied. 3. Short for chirp spread spectrum, CSS is a spread spectrum technique that transmits information in periodic bursts of variable frequency. These chirps are highly resistant to channel noise and multipath degradation, making them ideal for low-power, low-bitrate, long-distance communication. CSS is used in some LPWAN technologies to provide signal resilience in a distributed mesh of low-power transmitters, such as those found in IoT devices.

How to create an open and close curly bracket Creating the ' ' and ' ' symbols on a U.S. keyboard On English keyboards, the open bracket and close bracket are on the same key as the square bracket keys close to the Enter key. To get a curly bracket, press and hold the Shift key and then press the curly bracket keys. Creating the ' ' and ' ' symbol on a smartphone or tablet To create an open and close bracket a smartphone or tablet, open the keyboard and go into the numbers (123) and then (#+=) or symbols (sym) section and tap on the ' ' or ' ' symbol. How are curly brackets used? These keys are most commonly used in curly bracket programming languages such as C, Java, Perl, and PHP to enclose groups of statements or for a block of code. Below is an example of how an enclosed statement looks like in Perl. $value = 0; do   $value++; if ($value >= 10)   print 'Value is equal to or greater than 10. Ending.'; exit;     until ($value >= 100); In the above example, are two enclosed statements using curly brackets. The first group is the do loop that continues to increase the value of $value variable up to 100. Within that group is the if statement that checks to see if $value is greater than or equal to 10 and if it is print a message and exit the script. Keyboard terms, Programming terms, Square bracket Curry Curry is an experimental, multi-paradigm programming language introduced by Michael Hanus, Herbert Kuchen, and Juan Jose Moreno-Navarro in 1995. Its name is a homage to the logician Haskell Brooks Curry. The language was designed with the intention of 'combining the most important features of functional and logic languages… [which are  the most important declarative programming paradigms.' Curry code is either interpreted or compiled to the languages Prolog or Java. 'Hello, World!' in Curry main = print('Hello, World!') Related pages Programming language history. Haskell, Logic, Paradigm, Programming terms, Prolog CVS First developed in 1986, CVS (short for Concurrent Version System) is a software solution that helps software developers keep track of all the changes made to a program's source code. By using a CVS solution, a company can have several developers working on the same project without fear of overwriting each others' work or losing any changes. CVS also gives them the ability to view and revert to older versions, in case changes made caused conflicts. CVS was last updated in 2008. While still used for smaller projects, CVS lacks many features of modern revision control that are crucial for large-scale professional software development. Variants of CVS include CVSNT support case-insensitive file names, and OpenCVS, which uses stronger security methods. See our revision control page for a full listing of alternative modern revision control solutions. How does it work? CVS works by having a primary server or computer keep track of changes made when clients commit their changes to the server, rather than keeping multiple copies of the source code. When a client submits its data, if no conflicts exist with the server version and the client version, the two versions are merged. However, if conflicts exist before submitting the changes, the CVS program displays the conflicts for it to be changed or adjusted accordingly, so no conflicts occur after the merge. Compare, Computer acronyms, Diff, Programming terms, RCS, Subversion Cygwin Cygwin is a software interface that has the look and feel of a Unix environment, but is run in the Microsoft Windows operating system. Cygwin allows for integration between Windows applications and data and the Unix-like applications and data. It also provides a command line interface for Windows. It was originally developed by Cygnus Solutions in 1995 and later acquired by Red Hat in 2000, which continues to update and maintain it today, along with the help of NetApp. Cygwin is designed with two main parts. One part is a DLL (dynamic-link library), which serves as the API compatibility layer. This DLL provides much of the POSIX API functionality. The second part is a large set of applications and tools that have a look and feel similar to Unix. These applications and tools include file and system utilities, remote login capabilities, and file compression and archiving. Cygwin software packages that are used in Unix-like operating systems, including GNU command line tools such as cat, diff, grep, and the bash command shell. They also include support for programming languages like C++, Fortran, Perl, Python, and Ruby, as well as server and client support. Users have ported other Linux and Unix applications to Cygwin, like Apache, GNOME, and X Window System. Red Hat has kept Cygwin as an open source application, free for public use. Commercial licenses are also available for purchase to users who want to redistribute applications that use the Cygwin library.

It shows how information is input to and output from the system, the sources and destinations of that information, and where that information is stored. Information not shown in a DFD includes how long processes take, and whether those processes operate in series or parallel. Such information is often shown in a flowchart instead. Data flow, Processes, Programming terms Database Alternatively referred to as a databank or a datastore, and sometimes abbreviated as a DB, a database is a large quantity of indexed digital information. It can be searched, referenced, compared, changed or otherwise manipulated with optimal speed and minimal processing expense. A database is built and maintained by using a database programming language. The most common database language is SQL, but there are multiple 'flavors' of SQL, depending on the type of database being used. Each flavor of SQL has differences in the SQL syntax and are designed to be used with a specific type of database. For example, an Oracle database uses PL/SQL and Oracle SQL (Oracle's version of SQL). A Microsoft database uses T-SQL (Transact-SQL). Database components A database is made up of several main components. Schema - A database contains one or more schemas, which is basically a collection of one or more tables of data. - A database contains one or more schemas, which is basically a collection of one or more tables of data. Table - Each table contains multiple columns, which are similar to columns in a spreadsheet. A table can have as little as two columns and as many as one hundred or more columns, depending on the type of data being stored in the table. - Each table contains multiple columns, which are similar to columns in a spreadsheet. A table can have as little as two columns and as many as one hundred or more columns, depending on the type of data being stored in the table. Column - Each column contains one of several types of data or values, like dates, numeric or integer values, and alphanumeric values (also known as varchar). - Each column contains one of several types of data or values, like dates, numeric or integer values, and alphanumeric values (also known as varchar). Row - Data in a table is listed in rows, which are like rows of data in a spreadsheet. Often there are hundreds or thousands of rows of data in a table. How do you pronounce database?

The data gained from this process may be used for optimizing or debugging the software. Data-flow analysis often employs a CFG (control flow graph), similar to a flow chart, showing all possible paths of data through the program. Algorithm, Data flow, Programming terms Dataflow programming Dataflow programming, sometimes referred to as Dataflow, is a software architecture where variables have a defined relationship with one another. If the value of one variable changes, the values of the other variables are automatically updated. An everyday example of dataflow programming is a spreadsheet, where changing one value automatically changes many others based on a pre-defined formula. Architecture, Data flow, Programming terms Datalog Datalog is a purely declarative programming language derived from Prolog. It is used in many fields that require logic programming including networking, cloud computing, deductive database design, information extraction, and program analysis. Datalog is usually implemented in, or interpreted using, other programming languages. Open source Datalog implementations exist for Java, C++, Lua, Python, Prolog, Clojure, and Racket, and commercial Datalog implementations are also available. C++, Clojure, Java, Language, Programming terms, Python, Racket Data type Unlike humans, a computer does not know the difference between '1234' and 'abcd.' A data type is a classification that dictates what a variable or object can hold in computer programming. Data types are an important factor in virtually all computer programming languages, including C#, C++, JavaScript, and Visual Basic. When programmers create computer applications, both desktop and web-based, data types must be referenced and used correctly to ensure the proper result and an error-free program. Common examples of data types Boolean (e.g., True or False) Character (e.g., a) Date (e.g., 03/01/2016) Double (e.g., 1.79769313486232E308) Floating-point number (e.g., 1.234) Integer (e.g., 1234) Long (e.g., 123456789) Short (e.g., 0) String (e.g., abcd) Void (e.g., no data) Depending on the programming language, there may also be many more data types that serve a specific function and store data in a particular way. Understanding the different data types allows programmers to design computer applications more efficiently and accurately. Database terms, Programming terms DDE Short for Dynamic Data Exchange, DDE is a two-way connection between two or more programs that allow them to exchange and sync data while they are both running. API, Computer acronyms, Dynamic, Programming terms Dead code When referring to computer programming, dead code is any section of the source code whose results are never used by the program, resulting in unnecessary processing. Execute, Programming terms Debug Debug may refer to any of the following: 1. In general, debug refers to the process of examining and removing errors from a program's source code. For example, a developer may send a debug command through a program to see where in the code an error has occurred so he or she can resolve, or at least, bypass it. 2. Debug is also an MS-DOS and Windows command line command. See our debug command page for further details. Related pages Listing of computer debug routines. 3. In an FTP session, the debug command may be used to toggle debugging on and off. See how to use FTP for information about debug and other FTP commands. Bug, Debugger, Debugging, Error, Programming terms Debugger A debugger is a software utility that is designed to locate errors within a program's source code. Debug, Programming terms Debugging Debugging is a process of analyzing a computer program and removing its logical or syntactical errors. Software which assists in this process is known as a debugger. Using a debugger, a software developer can step through a program's code and analyze its variable values, searching for errors. Debug, Programming terms, Single step Declaration A declaration or declare may refer to any of the following: 1. In programming, a declaration is a statement that describes an identifier, such as the name of a variable or a function. Declarations are important because they inform the compiler or interpreter what the identifying word means, and how the identified thing should be used. A declaration may be optional or required, depending on the programming language. For example, in the C programming language, all variables must be declared with a specific data type before they can be assigned a value. Examples Below are some examples of declarations. use strict; my $help; The above perl statement declares a variable named $help. The dollar sign ($) indicates that the variable is a scalar. The special word my declares that $help has local lexical scope, meaning that outside the enclosing code block, the variable $help cannot be used. Note Perl does not require that variables be declared unless strict is being used. However, we always recommend using strict and declaring variable to help prevent problems with your code. Similarly, this Perl declaration: our $help; ...uses the special word our to declare that the scalar $help has global lexical scope. This declaration means that the variable can be used anywhere in the program, and any part of the program can change the value of $help. In some languages, a declaration and a value assignment can occur in a single statement. For example, in perl: my $help = 'Computer Hope'; ...declares a scalar variable $help with local scope, and assigns it the string value Computer Hope. In the C programming language, this declaration: int x; ...uses the special word int to declare that x is a variable of the integer data type. If the program tries to assign a non-integer value to x, the compiler will return an error. Similarly, char str[30 ; ...declares an array named str which can hold a maximum of 30 characters. Related pages How do I create a computer program? 2. When referring to a shell, declare is a builtin command of the Bash shell. See our declare command page for further information. Programming terms Declarative programming Declarative programming is a computer programming paradigm that the developer defines what the program should accomplish rather than explicitly defining how it should go about doing so. This approach lends itself naturally to the programmatic definition of formal logic systems, and has the benefit of simplifying the programming of some parallel processing applications.

Programming language, Programming terms Decrement A decrement is a programming operator that decreases a numerical value of its operand by 1. In Perl, a variable can be decremented by one by adding a -- at the end of the variable. In the example below, the value variable is set as five and then decremented in value by one with the $value--; line. The last line prints the new value of the variable, which is four. my $value = 5; $value--; print '$value '; Increment, Operator, Programming terms Deductive database A deductive database is a database system that can make conclusions about its data based on a set of well-defined rules and facts. This type of database was developed to combine logic programming with relational database management systems. Usually, the language used to define the rules and facts is the logical programming language Datalog. Data, Datalog, Programming terms Delimiter A delimiter is one or more characters that separate text strings. Common delimiters are commas (,), semicolon (;), quotes ( ', ' ), braces (  ), pipes (|), or slashes ( /   ). When a program stores sequential or tabular data, it delimits each item of data with a predefined character. Delimited text example For example, in the data 'john|doe,' a vertical bar (the pipe character, |) delimits the two data items john and doe. When a script or program reads the data, it treats a vertical bar as the end of one data item, and the beginning of another. In the following example of delimited text, each line contains contact information for a person. A program could be created to gather each of these values and display them in an easy to read or print format or parsed to find specific values. For example, you could quickly parse this file and find the name of all females. john|doe|male|123 street|555-1234 jane|smith|female|321 street|555-4321 bill|gates|male|987 street|555-9876 Tip If you are writing a script or program that has delimited text, we recommend using an uncommon delimiter. Using a comma as a delimiter has a good chance of getting split in the wrong place. If you need to use a comma as a delimiter, use two or three commas instead of only one unless the text is a name or something that does not have a comma (like an address). Example of using a delimiter in the Perl programming language use strict; my $example = 'John|Doe'; my ($first, $last) = split(/ |/, $example); print 'Hello $first, I see your last name is $last it is nice to meet you. ' In the example above, Perl code, the $example variable contains text with a pipe delimiter that is split into two new variables called $first and $last. Once the data is split, it prints the output results below. Hello John, I see your last name is Doe it is nice to meet you. Windows command line for command delimiter In the Windows command line for command, delimiters are specified using the delims= option. For example, delims=, indicates the delimiter is a comma. CSV, Divider, Programming terms, Separator, Spreadsheet terms Dependent variable A dependent variable is a variable that depends on a previous variable to determine its value. Programming terms Dereference operator In computer programming, a dereference operator, also known as an indirection operator, operates on a pointer variable and returns the location value, or l-value, that it points to in memory. In the C programming language, the deference operator is denoted with an asterisk (*). For example, in C, we can declare a variable x that holds an integer value, and a variable p that holds a pointer to an integer value in memory: int x; int *p; Here, the asterisk tells the compiler, 'p is not an integer, but rather a pointer to a location in memory which holds an integer.' Here, it is not a dereference, but part of a pointer declaration. Now we can set p to the location allocated for the value of x using the & operator, which means 'address of.' p = &x; This action tells the compiler, 'The address in memory that p points to is the address that you allocated for the integer x.' To illustrate, if we set the value of x to 1 using the conventional method, and print the value, the output will be 1. x = 1; printf('%d', x); However, we can also change the value of x by referencing p. We do this with an asterisk: *p = 2; printf('%d', x); And the output changes to 2. In other words, after p is declared as a pointer of the same type as x and then set to point to x's value, we can use x and *p interchangeably. Since they both refer to the same thing, changing the value of one will change the value of the other. Pointer, Programming terms, Variable Developer A developer is an individual who is responsible for creating or working on the development of a product or service. Most developers utilize one or more programming languages to develop their product or service. They may work alone or on a team, and may develop part of or all a product or service. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle employ many developers, due to the complexity of the products and services they develop and sell to customers. For example, a software developer is an individual that may create a new software program or maintain an existing software program. A web developer is an individual that creates or updates web pages, utilizing HTML, JavaScript, or other web programming languages. Business terms, Consultant, Engineer, Manufacturer, Programmer, System analyst, Technician DHTML Dynamic HTML or DHTML refers to a combination of regular HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and various programming languages to increase a web page's interactivity. Good examples are drag and drop features and drop-down menus that appear when a user moves their mouse over a certain section of the page. How it works DHTML is accomplished through the use of client-side scripting such as JavaScript and CSS, as well as server-side languages such as Perl and PHP, in conjunction with static HTML. DHTML is beneficial in that it can be used to create web pages that react to user input without sending requests to a web server. A good example of a DHTML page on our site is the Computer Hope system information script, which uses JavaScript to collect information from the browser. Computer acronyms, Dynamic, Interactive, Programming terms, Static, Web page Die A die may refer to any of the following: 1. The die or processor die is a rectangular pattern on a wafer that contains circuitry to perform a specific function. For example, the picture to the right shows hundreds of dies on the silicon wafer. After the dies have been finished, the wafer is cut and made into chips. 2. The term die may also refer to a command used in scripting and programming languages to stop the script or program from running. For example, in the following code, if the variable $i is greater than or equal to four, the script would die and print an error on the line number it died. Otherwise, it would print 'I didn't die!' to the screen. $i = 5; if ($i >= 4)   die;   else   print 'I didn't die!';   Exit, Programming terms, Wafer Diff Alternatively referred to as compare, diff is short for different or difference and describes a program's ability to show the difference between two or more files.

For, Loop, Programming terms, While DOM The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that exposes the elements of HTML and XML documents as programming language objects. The structure of the DOM for any document resembles the actual structure of the markup of the document. A web developer can programmatically manipulate the DOM to modify a web page, before or while it is viewed by the user. The most common programming language used in the DOM is JavaScript, which is used on most websites. Using JavaScript allows for dynamic changes to be made to the DOM, including hiding, moving, and animating certain HTML elements (such as text, tables, images, and entire divisions). In the past, the DOM had fundamental differences between browsers, but today has become much more standardized, allowing for easier cross-browser scripting to be performed by developers. A DOM example using HTML Consider the following HTML document: <html> <head> <title>Example</title> </head> <body> <h1>Example Page</h1> <p>This is an example page.</p> </body> </html> The DOM for this document includes all of the elements and any text nodes in those elements. The code in the previous example creates an object hierarchy as shown below. For each element under the document root (<html>), there is an element node, and these element nodes have text nodes containing the text that is in the element. If there were an element with attributes, an attribute node would be created for that element and any text for the attribute would create a text node under that attribute node.

It is a multi-paradigm language, meaning it supports static and dynamic programming, as well as both functional and object-oriented programming styles. Dylan's design was inspired primarily by LISP, but it more closely resembled the syntax of ALGOL by the time it was released as developers thought it would make the language easier to use. Its object-oriented characteristics are derived from CLOS and, in Dylan, all values are first-class objects, including numbers, characters, functions, and classes. Dylan programming language features Multiple inheritance: objects can inherit their characteristics from multiple superclasses. Polymorphism: functions and methods can operate in different ways on different object types. Named parameters: arguments to functions and methods may be identified by name, rather than by the order they appear. Pattern-based macro syntax: snippets of code can be re-used in different ways depending on the how the arguments are used.

In English, the ellipsis is often used as an indication to show any omitted word or other text. You'll often see an ellipsis in file names and commands on a computer to indicate the full file name or command is not being displayed. For example, as seen in the picture, a folder could be named 'Computer Hope' but displayed as 'Compute...' because the file name column is not wide enough to display the full file name. In computer programming a two period '..' or three period '...' ellipsis is often used to specify a range. For example, in the below Perl example 'Hello World!' would be printed 20 times. #!/usr/bin/perl foreach (1...20)   print 'Hello World! ';   Keyboard terms, Period, Programming terms, Word processor terms Else Else is a programming conditional statement that if previous conditions are not true displays alternate information or performs alternate commands. my $x = 10; if ($x == 10)   print 'X is equal to 10';   else   print 'X is not equal to 10';   Above is an example of Perl code that first sets the x variable as 10. If this value remains 10, then the first if statement prints 'X is equal to 10'. However, if this value changes it would print 'X is not equal to 10'.

Conditional statement, Else if, If statement, Programming terms Else if Alternatively referred to as elsif, else if is a conditional statement performed after an if statement that if true performs a function. Below is an example of an if, elsif, and else conditional statement in Perl. #!/usr/bin/perl print 'Enter number: '; my $number = <STDIN>; if ($number <= 10)   print 'Your number is less than or equal to 10';   elsif ($number <= 50)   print 'Your number is more than 10, but less than 50';   else   print 'Your number is greater than 50';   The above example shows how elsif could be used to create an additional conditional statement and not only an if or else statement. The above example could also be extended by adding as many elsif or else if statements as the program needed. Note Not all programming languages are the same, although this above example used elsif, in a different language such as ANSI C you would use else if, or elif may be used with Python.

It also supports desktop and server platforms like x86, x64, and more on many different operating systems. The two main types of embedded Java are Java ME, which is used for systems with lower specifications, and Java SE, which is used for systems with storage and RAM in excess of 32 MB each. More information on embedded Java can is on the Oracle website. Embedded, Java, Oracle, Programming terms Encapsulation Encapsulation may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to networking, encapsulation is the process of taking data from one protocol and translating it into another protocol, so the data can continue across a network. For example, a TCP/IP packet contained within an ATM frame is a form of encapsulation. Related pages Computer network and network card help and support. 2. When referring to programming, encapsulation is information in a module or section of code that enables the program or programmer to use code contained within a program. Network terms, Programming terms, Tunnel Encode Encode means to change something into a programming code. For instance, changing a letter into the binary code for that letter or changing an analog sound into a digital file. A good example of where you are most likely to encounter encoding is what happens in your browser. The URL only supports so many characters, any other characters such as a space must be encoded to be understood. For example, if we wanted to have 'computer hope' in the URL with the space it would be encoded to 'computer%20hope'.

It can also be the order of bits in a byte. Big-endian and little-endian are the common forms of endianness, and middle-endian is another. Programming terms Endless loop Alternatively referred to as an infinite loop or a continuous loop, an endless loop is a continuous repetition of a program segment. For example, when creating a batch file, an endless loop can be created by using the GOTO statement that refers back to the beginning of the loop. :BEGIN Echo I am an endless loop! GOTO BEGIN As illustrated in the above example, the program will print 'I am an endless loop!' and then go back to the BEGIN statement and repeat this process indefinitely. Loop, Programming terms EOF EOF may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for end-of-file, EOF is a code placed by a computer after a file's last byte of data. EOF marks are helpful in data transmission and storage. Files are stored in blocks, and the end marker helps the computer know it has allocated enough space to store the file. The EOF is commonly represented by pressing and holding Ctrl and pressing Z in DOS and OS/2 or pressing and holding Ctrl and pressing D in Unix. 2. In programming languages, such as C, EOF is a return value defined in studio.h that is used to indicate the end of the file. Computer abbreviations, Programming terms, TOF Epoch Sometimes referred to as epoch time, POSIX time, and Unix time, epoch is an operating system starting point that determines a computer's time and date by counting the ticks from the epoch. Below is a listing of different operating systems and their associated tick and epoch. Operating System Tick Epoch Apple macOS 1 sec January 1, 1904 to February 6, 2040. Microsoft DOS 1 sec January 1, 1980 to January 1, 2108. Microsoft Windows 100 ns January 1, 1601 to AD 30828. OpenVMS 100 ns November 17, 1858 to AD 31086. POSIX 1 sec January 1, 1970 to January 19, 2038. S/390 244.14 picosec January 1, 1970 to January 19, 2038. Unix 1 sec January 1, 1970 to January 19, 2038. If you want to figure out the difference between two epoch values, do the following. Use the table below to determine how many hours, seconds, days difference there is by subtracting the two epoch values and then dividing by equivalent number of seconds. For example, if the difference between the two was 14,400, dividing that by 3600 shows the difference is 4 hours. Time period Epoch second equivalent 1 minute 60 1 hour 3600 1 day 86400 1 week 604800 2 weeks 1209600 3 weeks 1814400 1 month 2419200 6 months 14515200 1 year 29030400 1 decade 290304000 Why is an epoch used instead of a date? Converting a date and time into an epoch value makes it much easier to find the difference, add, and subtract from a time value. For example, you could convert the time to an epoch and subtract it from another epoch value to quickly determine the difference. If the difference was 176,400 and you used the above chart or a math formula to find the difference is 2 days and 1 hour (86400 + 86400 + 3600 = 176,400). Example of converting an epoch Many programming languages and some programs have functions that can be used to help convert and epoch. If you have an epoch value that you need to convert, you can also use an online epoch converter to convert the values into a readable date. Julian, Measurement, Operating system terms, Programming terms, Tick, Time EQ EQ may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for equals, eq is an operator used in programming languages and in command line commands as an abbreviation for equals. For example, in programming languages such as Perl, you could type: if ($example eq $test)   print 'They are equal';   In the above example, if the contents in $exmaple variable is the same as $test, then the program would print 'They are equal' to the screen. 2. Short for equalizer, eq is software or hardware that strengthens or weakens individual frequency ranges of an electronic signal, such as an audio signal. For example, strengthening low frequencies of an audio signal will increase the bass tones, and strengthening high frequencies will increase the treble. Hardware equalizers are a common feature of high-end audio equipment, featuring sliding buttons for each frequency range. Software equalizers are often included in media player software, such as iTunes, VLC, and Winamp. Pictured below is the software equalizer featured in Windows Media Player. 3. Short for EverQuest, EQ, also known as EverCrack for its addictiveness, was a popular MMORPG game. It was shut down in November 2013. Its sequel, EverQuest II, was launched on November 9, 2004, and converted to a free-to-play game (with microtransactions) in November 2011. The official EverQuest website is https://www.everquest.com/home. Computer abbreviations, Equal, Equalizer APO, Game terms, Ne, Programming terms, Sound terms Equal Equal is a value or data that is the same or equivalent to another value and is represented by the = symbol. The equal sign symbol shares the same key as the plus (+) on a keyboard and is next to the backspace key. Where is the equals sign on the keyboard? Below is an overview of a computer keyboard with the equals key highlighted in blue. Note Apple computer keyboards with a numeric keypad also have an equal sign above the number eight. How to create the = symbol Creating the = symbol on a U.S. keyboard To create an equals sign using a U.S. keyboard press the equals key, which is on the same key as the plus ( + ) and to the left of backspace or delete depending on your keyboard. Creating the = symbol on a smartphone or tablet To create a hyphen on a smartphone or tablet open the keyboard and go into the numbers (123) or symbols (sym) section and then press your finger on the = symbol. What is the equals sign used for on a computer? With computers, the equals sign is commonly used in programming and mathematics to show a total value or assign a value. The following sections contain some examples of how the equals sign is used. Equals in a math formula In a math formula, the equals sign shows the result of the formula. For example, in the formula below, you can see that 2 - 1 is equal to 1. 2 - 1 = 1 Equals in an excel formula In Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet programs, all formulas begin with the equal sign. In the formula below, all cells between A1 and A10 are added together, and the result is returned to the cell containing the formula. =sum(A1:A10) Equals in computer programming The equals sign is used in many programming languages to assign a variable a value as shown in the example below, which assigns the variable '$myvariable' the value of 'Computer Hope.' my $myvariable = 'Computer Hope'; An equal value in computer programming In programming languages, the equal symbol is also an operator in a conditional statement. For example, eq or == (double equal sign) can be used to check if a value is equal to another value. In the example below, if the variable '$myval' is equal to 10, then print 'The value equals 10,' otherwise print 'Value is not equal to 10' to the screen. if ($myval == 10)   print 'The value equals 10';   else   print 'Value is not equal to 10';   Ge, Keyboard terms, Le, Ne, Programming terms Errorlevel In Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS, an errorlevel is the integer number returned by a child process when it terminates. Errorlevel is 0 if the process was successful. Errorlevel is 1 or greater if the process encountered an error. Testing errorlevel Testing errorlevel is useful when you are executing a series of commands, either at the command line or in a batch file. Using a conditional expression, you can specify a series of commands to occur only if a previous command was successful. You can also test for failure, executing commands only if the previous command failed. Sometimes, if the program supports it, you can also test for specific types of errors. You may also branch command execution, so that a different set of commands is executed if the previous command failed. Conditional 'if [not  errorlevel' The conditional expression 'if errorlevel n' is true if the errorlevel is greater than or equal to n. Similarly, 'if not errorlevel n' is true if the errorlevel is less than n. Let's look at some examples of how these can be used, by running some commands on the Windows command line. To begin, open a command prompt window: press Win + X (hold down the Windows key and press X), and choose Command Prompt. Now let's run a simple command: mkdir mydirectory When we run mkdir (assuming there is not already a directory called 'mydirectory' in the current directory), the directory mydirectory is created. The command was successful, so when mkdir terminates, it sets the errorlevel to 0. Let's test for errorlevel 0. Testing success: 'if not errorlevel' We can test for errorlevel 0 (success) with the conditional statement if not errorlevel 1. If that's true (errorlevel is less than 1), the command which follows the conditional will run. In the examples below, we'll use the echo command to print a message on the screen. if not errorlevel 1 echo The last command was successful. The last command was successful. As indicated, the mkdir command we ran above was successful. However, if we try to make the directory again, mkdir will fail, because the directory mydirectory already exists: mkdir mydirectory A subdirectory or file example already exists. When mkdir fails, it provides its own error message, 'A subdirectory or file example already exists,' and sets the errorlevel to 1. If we run our conditional statement again: if not errorlevel 1 echo The last command was successful. Nothing happens. Our echo command does not run, because we tested for success — errorlevel less than 1 — and that condition is false. Testing failure: 'if errorlevel' We can specifically test for failure with if errorlevel 1, which returns true if the errorlevel is 1 or greater. if errorlevel 1 echo The last command failed. The last command failed. The condition is met (because mkdir previously set the errorlevel to 1), and the echo command runs. It would also run if the errorlevel was 2, 3, 4, etc. If the errorlevel was 0, it would not run. Branching execution with if..else In the above examples, we tested for success or failure, but not both. We can test for both success and failure by using an if/else statement of the form: if [not  errorlevel n (command1) else (command2) Note The parentheses are necessary to separate the commands from the word else. For example: mkdir newtest if not errorlevel 1 (echo Success) else (echo Failure) Success mkdir newtest A subdirectory or file newtest already exists. if not errorlevel 1 (echo Success) else (echo Failure) Failure %ERRORLEVEL% environment variable Often, the errorlevel is also stored in the environment variable %ERRORLEVEL%. Its value is a convenient way to access your current errorlevel. In the following example, we run the dir command twice, once successfully, and once unsuccessfully. After each, we echo the value of %ERRORLEVEL%. mkdir example dir example Directory of C: Users Hope example 06/10/2018 09:43 PM <DIR> . 06/10/2018 09:43 PM <DIR> .. 0 File(s) 0 bytes 2 Dir(s) 50,671,132,672 bytes free echo %ERRORLEVEL% 0 dir misspelled Directory of C: Users Hope File Not Found echo %ERRORLEVEL% 1 Using %ERRORLEVEL% in conditionals You can use %ERRORLEVEL% in conditionals, for example: if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 echo Errorlevel is not equal to zero, the last command failed. Tip NEQ is the relational operator which means 'not equal to.' Note: %ERRORLEVEL% is not always correct %ERRORLEVEL% is not the same as if [not  errorlevel, and the two values are not always the same. Specifically, %ERRORLEVEL% does not always get updated when the errorlevel changes. For more information, see this MSDN blog post by Raymond Chen. For this reason, if you are testing errorlevel in a production environment, it's better to use if [not  errorlevel. Errorlevel lookup tool For advanced users and software developers, Microsoft has released a command-line errorlevel lookup tool, err.exe. It allows you to search for errorlevels by number or internal name, and restrict your search by the header file in which the errorlevel is defined. err /winerror.h 0 # winerror.h selected. # for hex 0x0 / decimal 0 : ERROR_SUCCESS winerror.h # The operation completed successfully. NO_ERROR winerror.h SEC_E_OK winerror.h S_OK winerror.h # 4 matches found for '0' err /cmdmsg.h 9009 # cmdmsg.h selected. # for decimal 9009 / hex 0x2331 : MSG_DIR_BAD_COMMAND_OR_FILE cmdmsg.h # '%1' is not recognized as an internal or external command, # operable program or batch file. # 1 matches found for '9009' You can download the tool directly from Microsoft. Programming terms Error An error is a term used to describe any issue that arises unexpectedly that cause a computer to not function properly. Computers can encounter either software errors or hardware errors. How to fix a computer error As shown in the next section, there are dozens of different types of errors that can each have hundreds of variations. To fix a computer error, you must first identify the type of error and the source. For example, with a blue screen error message in Windows a file name, the type of error as well as the memory location may be given. This information can be used in a search engine to find a fix to the error. If no error message is given, search for the symptom you are experiencing. For example, if the computer is turning off it is likely a hardware problem and not a computer error. Software errors are the most common types of errors on a computer and are often fixed with software updates or patches. Hardware errors are any defects with hardware inside the computer or connected to the computer. Although some hardware issues can be fixed with firmware updates, most of these errors are resolved by replacing the defective hardware. Computer error messages Below is a listing of the different errors and error messages a computer may encounter. Clicking on any of the links below give you additional information about that error. What is the difference between an error and bug? An error is a message shown to the user of a program, and a bug is a problem in the code that is causing the error to be shown. See our bug page for a full explanation and history of computer bugs. 404, Abend, Artifact, Bug, Crash, Damage, Debugging, Error Code, Error control, Errorlevel, Error rate, Fad, Failure, Fault, Glitch, Invalid, Panic, Problem, Programming terms, Sic, Slow, Troubleshoot Esac Esac denotes the end of a case statement in some computer languages, such as in Linux or Unix shell scripts. Programming terms Esc Esc may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for Escape, Esc is a key found on the top-left corner of a computer keyboard and allows the user to abort or cancel an operation. For example, if a slow web page was loading on an Internet browser, you could press the Escape key to stop the download and not have to wait for it to timeout. The picture to the right is a close up picture of what the Esc key looks like on a computer keyboard. Where is the Escape key on the keyboard? Below is an overview of a computer keyboard with the Esc key highlighted in blue. Note Apple Macbooks with the Touch Bar do not have a physical Esc key. Why and where is the Esc key used? An Escape key is used in a program when you want to abort, cancel or change what is currently being displayed on the screen. Below are some difference places the Escape key is commonly used. Does the Esc key send a break? With some early computers, the Esc key was used to send a break. However, today the Esc key is not used to perform a break. With a PC you can usually press Ctrl+C to send a break and stop a loop. Related Esc key pages Computer keyboard help and support. 2. Escape is shorthand for an escape character. An escape character is a single backward slash (   ) in Linux, programming, and regular expressions that treats the character after it as text and not a function. It can also be used to perform a special function. Below are some examples of how an escape could be used.  ' or  ' The above example treats the quote character as a quote character and not a beginning or end container. For example, in programming languages such as Perl, this is required if you're printing text to a file or the screen that contains a quote. In other words, the command print 'Example of a  ' quote.'; would print Example of a ' quote. Without escaping the quote, the Perl script would generate an error because of the extra quote.  * The example above would treat the asterisk as a plain text asterisk and not as a wildcard or metacharacter.  . This next example is similar to the first example because the period is also a wildcard, which represents any single character. So, if you need to match a period in a regular expression and not every character, you must escape it to be recognized as a period.   When a file name or directory needs a space in Linux, you can use a backward slash followed by a space, to escape the space in a name. If this isn't done, Linux will treat anything after the space as an option or additional command. Finally, escape characters are also used in escape sequences, to create a function or command. For example, the above would create a newline character to the file or screen. See our escape sequence page for additional examples. 3. Short for escalation, esc is used to describe or refer to an escalation number dealing with an important customer related issue. Cancel, Escape sequence, Keyboard terms, Magic quotes, Meta-character, Programming terms, Stop Escape sequence Invented by Bob Bemer, an escape sequence is two or more characters that often begin with an escape character that tells the computer or software program to perform a function or command. Below is a listing of some of the commonly used and available escape sequences used in programming languages and some text editors. Below is an example of how an escape sequence appears to a computer and then how it is displayed to the user. Hello. Here is an example of text that uses escape sequences. The above example with escape sequences would display the below text. Hello. Here is an example of text that uses escape sequences. Finally, adding an escape sequence into a regex (regular expression) can allow you to find and replace characters or perform a special feature. For example, in the example below of a Perl regular expression in a while loop we're finding any line that begins with a character return and deleting it. while (<ofile>)   $line = $_; $line =~ s/^ //g;   Escape, Programming terms, Regex Eval A eval may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for evaluate, eval is a function that can be found in different interpreted and compiled programming languages. This function can have a variety of different abilities depending on the programming language you're using. For example, in Perl, PHP, and JavaScript the eval command can be used to interpret a variable string as code and execute it. Example of eval in Perl my $one = 1; my $two = 2; my $total = 0; my $example = '$total = $one + $two'; eval $example; print $total; In the above example, the string stored in the $example variable is executed using the eval command. A programmer could take this expression further by executing a complete Perl program stored in another file. 2. When referring to a shell, eval is a builtin command of the Bash shell. See our eval command page for further information. Computer abbreviations, Programming terms Event-driven programming Event-driven programming is a computer programming paradigm in which control flow of the program is determined by the occurrence of events. These events are monitored by code known as an event listener. If it detects that an assigned event has occurred, it runs an event handler (a callback function or method that is triggered when the event occurs). In theory, all programming languages support the event-driven style of programming, although some language features, such as closures, make it easier to implement. Other programming environments, such as Adobe Flash, are specifically tailored for triggering program code by events. Paradigm, Programming terms Event listener An event listener is a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur. Examples of an event are the user clicking or moving the mouse, pressing a key on the keyboard, disk I/O, network activity, or an internal timer or interrupt. The listener is programmed to react to an input or signal by calling the event's handler. The term event listener is often specific to Java and JavaScript. In other languages, a subroutine that performs a similar function is referred to as an event handler. The following JavaScript code would add an event listener to an HTML document: document.addEventListener('click', myfunction, false); In this example, when the HTML is rendered in a browser, the listener calls the function 'myfunction' (which must be defined elsewhere in the script) any time the user clicks the mouse button. Event, Input, Programming terms, Signal, Subroutine Event In programming, an event is an action that occurs as a result of the user or another source, such as a mouse being clicked, or a key being pressed. An event handler is a routine that is used to deal with the event, allowing a programmer to write code that will be executed when the event occurs. Other common event examples A web browser completely loading a web page. A file being created or modified on a filesystem. A hardware sensor such as a webcam or microphone receiving sensory input. The arrival of incoming network traffic. The occurrence of an error at the program or system level. Events on the Web Another example of an event is a user clicking on a button within a web page. This action creates what is known as a 'click' event. JavaScript could then be used to program a reaction to the event, for instance, you could use the onclick event handler shown in the following box: <form action='#' method='post'> <input type='button' value='Click for a Message' onclick='window.alert('Hello!');'> </form> The code reacts to a click event on the button, sending the 'Hello' message the viewer. To see this in action, be sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser and click the below button. Browser, Error, Event listener, Filesystem, Network, Programming terms, Web page Exception In computer programming, an exception is a special condition encountered during program execution that is unexpected or anomalous. For example, if the program tries to open a file from disk, but the file does not exist or there is a disk read error, this condition is an exception. Exceptions must be anticipated by the programmer and properly handled in the program code, branching program execution as appropriate to avoid a fatal error. This aspect of computer programming is known as exception handling. Related pages How to fix a fatal exception error. Fatal exception, Programming terms Exception handling Exception handling is the process of responding to exceptions when a computer program runs. An exception occurs when an unexpected event happens that requires special processing. Examples include a user providing abnormal input, a file system error being encountered when trying to read or write a file, or a program attempting to divide by zero. Exception handling attempts to gracefully handle these situations so that a program (or worse, an entire system) does not crash. Exception handling can be performed at both the software (as part of the program itself) and hardware levels (using mechanisms built into the design of the CPU). Example of exception handling in JavaScript try   console.log(test);   catch (err)   console.log('Error encountered: ' + err); console.log('Continuing with the rest of our program…');   Here, console.log(test) tells the program to print the value of a variable named 'test' to the console. However, we have not yet defined this variable, so the console.log method generates an error. Normally, this would cause the program to crash, but here we have enclosed the error-causing code in a try-catch statement. The program 'tries' to run console.log(test), and if it works, the catch block is skipped. But if it causes an error, the error is 'caught' — instead of the program crashing, the catch block is executed. Our program produces the output: Error encountered: ReferenceError: test is not defined Continuing with the rest of our program... Hardware, Programming terms, Software, Statement Exec Exec may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to a command line such as Linux or Unix, exec is a BOURNE and POSIX shell command that replaces the current shell process with the command specified after exec. This command does not create a new PID. For example, if you were to run exec <command>, the shell would be replaced by that command. When that command is exited, the shell will exit. Tip If you're trying to execute a script or program use type ./ in front of the script or program, don't use exec. 2. When referring to a programming or scripting language such as C, Perl, or PHP, exec is a function that executes a program from within a program. For example, in Perl, you could use the following line to print the files in the current directory on a Linux system. exec 'ls' 3. With an SSI, the exec command is used to execute a command on the server and display the output to the web page. For example, if we wanted to display the same output used in the above example on a web page using SSI, you could use a command similar to the following example. <!--#exec cmd='ls'--> Command, Execute, Fork, PID, Programming terms Exists A function used to determine if something is valid or found. For example, in Perl the exists function could be used with an array or a hash to determine if a value exists. In the example below, if the example value exists in the test array the computer would print 'Test exists...' to the computer screen. print 'Test exists...' if exists $test example ; Some programming languages or script languages also use exist, which performs the same or similar function, but under a different name. For example, the MS-DOS if command can use an exist function. See the MS-DOS if command page for further information and examples of how to use the MS-DOS if command. Exist, If statement, Programming terms Exponent In mathematics, an exponent is a symbol or number placed above and after another symbol or number. For example, with 22, x3, and xn the 2, 3, and n are all exponents. In the case of 22, if you were to put this into a calculator (2^2), it would equal 4. See our scientific notation page on converting numbers to numbers with exponents. How to type an exponent If you are writing a document, HTML web page, or other text and need to create an exponent, you can create an exponent using superscript. See our superscript page for further information about this setting. Exponents in programming languages Because the caret '^' is used as a special character in programming languages to perform tasks, the appropriate symbol for 'raised to the nth power' is two asterisks. For example, if you need to solve a problem such as '210' in a programming language, you would type '2**10' as is shown in the following example written in Perl. use strict; my $variable = 2**10; print '$variable '; Running the above Perl script would return '1024' to the screen. Floating-point notation, Googolplex, Programming terms, Scientific notation, Superscript Exponential backoff An exponential backoff is an algorithm that uses a pre-defined process to gradually, multiplicatively decrease the rate of an operation to find a more acceptable rate. For example, the protocols that govern Ethernet network communications use an exponential backoff to gradually reduce the rate of data transmission if a packet collision is detected. Network, Programming terms, Transmission Expression An expression may refer to any of the following: 1. A combination of letters, numbers, or symbols used to represent a value of a variable. Expressions are found and used in programming languages, databases, and spreadsheets. Below are some basic examples of expressions in the Perl programming language. $test = 'example text'; In the above example, 'example text' is the expression of the $test variable. $total = $value1 + $value2; In the above example, the total value of $value1 and $value2 is the expression of the $total variable. In other words, if $value1 and $value2 both had an expression of '1' then the $total expression is equal to two. 2.

Conditional expression, Operand, Programming terms, Regular expression, Variable F programming language The F programming language, also known as F, is used to write computer programs that have scientific applications. It is a modern subset of the Fortran programming language, and it is backward-compatible Fortran 77. Hello, World! written in F program hello print *, 'Hello World!' end program hello Hello World, Programming language, Programming terms False In programming, false is a Boolean value that is used when the result of a logical statement is false (as opposed to true). For example, you may want to check whether two values are equal and run one block of code when this is true and a different block of code if this is not true. Below, is an example of some JavaScript code as an example. var x = 2; var y = 2; if (x === y)   window.alert('x equal to y is true');   else   window.alert('x equal to y is not true');   In this code, if x is equal to y, the user receives an alert that says 'x equal to y is true'. If it is false, the user receives an alert that says 'x equal to y is false'. Boolean, Programming terms, True First-class object In computer programming, a first-class object, also known as a first-class citizen or a first-class value, is a language entity — a number, a function, or a variable, for instance — that can be operated the same way as any other entity in the language. For example, in the C programming language, you cannot pass a function to another function as a parameter, so in C, functions are referred to as 'second-class objects.' However, in JavaScript a function can be passed to another function as a parameter, therefore in JavaScript, functions are first-class. Programming terms, Value Flag A flag may refer to any of the following: 1. A flag is bit of information that can have an ON or OFF value, more commonly represented as 1 or 0. For example, in the win.ini on an IBM compatible computer running Microsoft Windows a flag to set the wallpaper to tiled on is: TileWallpaper=1. 2. A flag is also a mark that indicates a certain event has taken place, or that an object is unusual in some way. For example, in the world of computer programming, and error flag indicates that some or all the code is not working properly. 3. In an e-mail program, a flag is a visual reminder of an important e-mail. For example, as you are going through e-mail if there is a message that is important or needs to be dealt with later, it can be flagged for quick access in the future. Attribute, E-mail terms, Programming terms Flat file Alternatively referred to as a flat database or text database, a flat file is a file of data that does not contain links to other files or is a non-relational database. A good example of a flat file is a single text-only file that contains all the data needed for a program that is often separated by some kind of delimiter. A flat database is much easier to understand and setup than a traditional database, but may be inadequate for any program that is frequently used or contains millions of entries. Below is a basic example of how data in a flat file may appear and be used in a Perl program. Flat file example Bob|123 street|California|$200.00 Nathan|800 Street|Utah|$10.00 Perl script to read flat file use strict; my (@users, $users, @display, $display); open (EXAMPLE, '<flatfile.txt') || die; @users = <EXAMPLE>; close(EXAMPLE); foreach $users (@users)   chomp($users); @display = split(/ |/, $users); print '$display[0  $display[1  $display[2  Hello $display[0 , You currently owe us $display[3 , please pay us as soon as possible. ';   In the above example, the Perl script first opens the flatfile.txt and places the data into any array. The script then uses the foreach command to go through each line in the array (file) and as it goes through each line splits each line into its own array using the pipe delimiter. After it's loaded into its own array, each segment of the array can be called, for example '$display[0 ' is the first element of the array. So for the first line the script would print the below message. Bob 123 street California Hello Bob, You currently owe us $200.00, please pay us as soon as possible. CSV, Database, Database terms, Programming terms Floating-point In programming, a floating-point is a variable type that is used to store floating-point number values. A floating-point number is one where the position of the decimal point can 'float' rather than being in a fixed position within a number. Examples of floating-point numbers are 1.23, 87.425, and 9039454.2. Different programming languages or systems may have different size limits or ways of defining floating-point numbers. Consult the language documentation for details. Data type, Float, Floating-point notation, FPU, Programming terms, Whole number For For may refer to any of the following: 1. A loop statement in programming that performs predefined tasks while or until a predetermined condition is met. Below is an example of a for loop in Perl that prints 'Computer Hope' five times. for ($i = 1; $i < 6; $i++)   print 'Computer Hope ';   In the above example, the for loop first sets the variable $i to a value of 1. Each time it executes, the $i variable is increased by 1 and while the $i variable is less than 6, 'Computer Hope' is printed to the screen. Tip Like any loop, when creating a for loop, make sure its condition will always be met to help prevent an endless loop. 2. For is also a Windows command line command, see the for command page for information. 3. Linux command, see the for command page for further information about this command. Do, Foreach, Loop, Programming terms, While Foreach Foreach may refer to any of the following: 1. Foreach is a loop statement in programming that performs predefined tasks while or until a predetermined condition is met. For example, in Perl you can use a foreach loop that prints all the elements of an array one by one. Sample code: Foreach on array in Perl foreach $value (@value)   print '$value ';   If the elements of the array was 'one,' 'two,' and 'three' each would be printed on a new line by itself. Foreach on hash in Perl In the next example, the foreach would step through a hash displaying the hash and the key value. foreach $example (keys %value)   print '$example = $value $example ';   Related pages How do I create a computer program? 2. Foreach is also a Linux command, see the foreach command page for further information. Do, For, Loop, Programming terms, While Forth Programming language developed by Charles H. Moore in 1970 on an IBM 1130. Forth was considered a fourth generation programming language. However, because the IBM 1130 only supported five characters for a file name, it was named forth. Generation languages, Programming terms FORTRAN Short for Formula Translation, Fortran was one of the first programming languages. Development of FORTRAN began in 1954 by John Backus and members of the IBM team, and was first introduced to the public on October 15, 1956. It was a very popular programming language and is still used today. Fortran history Below is a brief history of FORTRAN. FORTRAN - 1954 FORTRAN II - 1958 FORTRAN III - 1958 (Never released to public) FORTRAN IV - 1961 FORTRAN 66 - 1972 FORTRAN 77 - 1980 Fortran 90 - 1991 Fortran 95 - 1997 Fortran 2003 - Published as ISO/IEC in 2004. Fortran 2008 - Published as ISO/IEC in September 2010. Fortran 2018 - Formerly known as Fortran 2015, Fortran 2018 is still in development. Should I use 'Fortran' or 'FORTRAN' in my writing? According to the Microsoft Manual of Style you should not use all uppercase 'FORTRAN' and it should never be spelled out as 'Formula Translation.' If you're writing about versions of FORTRAN before Fortran 90, use FORTRAN in your writing. However, if you're writing about Fortran in general or writing about more recent versions of Fortran do not uppercase the word. COBOL, Computer acronyms, GCC, High-level language, Procedural language, Programming terms Framework When referring to computer software, a framework is a foundation with a specified level of complexity (based on user level) that a programmer may extend using their own code. It might include a set of software libraries, compilers, interpreters, or an API. In general, it provides an environment that facilitates a specific type of programming for a software development project. Most software frameworks are characterized by a design philosophy called IoC (Inversion of Control). Normally, computer programs define a program's flow of control and make calls to libraries for individual functions. When using a framework, however, the relationship is inverted: the framework manages the overall control flow and makes calls to the user's code when needed. A frameworks allows the developer to focus on details specific to the project and bypass the more general requirements. Examples of software frameworks include AJAX APIs, multimedia authoring and scripting tools, and web application middleware. API, Flow of control, Programming terms, Software development, Web application F# Pronounced as 'eff sharp,' F# is an open source, cross-platform. Functional-first programming language first developed by Don Syme at Microsoft brings functional programming to Microsoft's .NET platform. Below is a basic example of printing 'HelloWorld!' to the screen. // Print hello world printfn 'Hello World!' Related pages The official F# page is http://fsharp.org. Programming language history.

API, Business terms, Code, Database, Programming terms, Protocol, Server-side, Software development process, User experience, User interface, Web application, Web server Function Function may refer to any of the following: 1. In general, the functionality of something refers to the overall quality and how well something performs. For example, a software program may have improved functionality over previous versions with new features and options that were not available in past versions. 2. In mathematics, a function is a relationship between two mathematical statements, or sets of numbers, in which every element of one corresponds to an element of the other. For example, in the function f(x) = x + 1 (pronounced 'F of x equals x plus one'), every number, x, corresponds to exactly one other number, that is greater than x by exactly 1. 3. A function is a group of instructions, also known as a named procedure, used by programming languages to return a single result or a set of results. See the subroutine definition for a full definition. 4. Excel functions are designed to provide one word access to a series of operations. There are several dozen functions and they are organized according to their purposes. For example, in the excel formula '=SUM(A1:A10),' a function that adds all the numbers in the range of cells specified in the formula. You can go to the Formulas tab (in Excel 2010) or click the formulas button and see all available functions as shown in the example below. Formula, Function call, Function keys, Programming terms, Spreadsheet terms, Subroutine, UDF Functional programming Functional programming is a style of computer programming that is based upon the evaluation of mathematical functions. It is a declarative style of programming, meaning that it uses clearly defined logical expressions, but does not explicitly state what the computer should do at each step. An axiom of functional programming is that a function should return the same result for any given set of arguments. Functions adhere to this concept, 'same arguments, same result,' no matter how many times the function is evaluated. A common feature of functional programming is immutable objects). When the value of an immutable object is set, it cannot be changed. Instead, copies of the object are created and modified. Using this approach, increases data security and simplifies the process of debugging. Examples of functional programming languages Idempotence, Programming language, Programming terms Fuzz testing Fuzz testing, also known as fuzzing or monkey testing, is a technique used to test software for unknown vulnerabilities. The fuzz testing process is automated by a program known as a fuzzer, which comes up with a large amount of data to send to the target program as input. If the target program crashes or behaves in an undesirable way, the fuzzer makes a log of the input that caused the error. Hackers often use fuzzers to look for vulnerabilities in software, probing it for weaknesses they can exploit. Software developers can use a fuzzer to anticipate and defend against those types of attacks. Origin The first fuzzer was written in the early 1980s by developer Steve Capps to test for weakness in programs for the Macintosh computer. He called his program 'The Monkey,' referring to the classic adage of a monkey pressing random keys on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time. The theory is that given enough time, the monkey will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare. Although this approach to software testing is often called 'fuzzing,' it is also called 'monkey testing' because of Capps' program. List of Fuzzers Fuzzing techniques can be used to test software, and many fuzzers exist for specific purposes. The following is a list of fuzzers, most of them being open-source and many still in active development. The following are fuzzing harnesses, or frameworks, which can help you to manage your fuzz testing.

Bug, Programming terms, Security terms, Software testing Game of Life The Game of Life, also known as Life or Conway's Game of Life, is a zero-player 'game' created in 1970 by mathematician John Conway. Given an initial state, a two-dimensional cellular grid of finite automata changes over time in a series of generations. Each cell survives, dies, or reproduces based upon how many adjacent neighbors it has. Conway's game (screenshot shown right) led to the creation of a new field of mathematics called cellular automata. It remains famous as a simple, instructive program for students of computer programming. Turing Completeness Conway's game of life represents a Turing-complete or 'Universal' machine. It's been proven possible (although difficult and inefficient) to create any other computer using only the rules in Conway's game. Game of Life's four rules Isolation: Any living cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies. Balance: Any living cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation. Overcrowding: Any living cell with more than three live neighbors dies. Reproduction: Any dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes alive. Game terms, Generation, Programming terms Gang of Four Gang of Four refers to Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides, the authors of the seminal software engineering book 'Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software'. Design Patterns was first published in 1994, and to date is in its 40th printing. The book is highly influential in the field of software engineering and considered an important source for object-oriented design theory and practice.

Object-oriented, Programming terms, Software engineering Garbage collection In computer programming, garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management invented by John McCarthy in the 1950s, as part of his development of Lisp. How garbage collection works Computer programs allocate memory for data objects: they stake their claim to certain areas in memory, telling the rest of the system 'this memory is in use, and no other programs can use it.' When the program no longer needs this area of memory, it must be 'released' before it can be used by other data objects, or system processes. In some programming languages, this must be done manually (the programmer must explicitly allocate and free up memory as part of the program itself). Garbage collection automates this process by using an agent process (the 'garbage collector') to search for allocated memory that could not possibly be used by the program in the future. It identifies this 'stale' memory and frees it, making it available to be used for something else. Some programming languages require garbage collection as part of their specification (for instance Java, C#, and Go). Other languages were designed for manual memory management, but have garbage collection implementations (like C and C++). Still, other languages such as Ada allow garbage collection and manual memory management to coexist in the same application. Benefits of garbage collection Garbage collection has the advantage of eliminating human error. Programs that manage memory manually may contain errors which access it incorrectly, causing the program to crash, or exposing the system to security vulnerabilities. However, garbage collection requires additional system resources, and the collection itself may occur at unpredictable times, making the speed and efficiency of programs less reliable. Memory management, Programming terms Gaussian pyramid The Gaussian pyramid is a technique in image processing that breaks down an image into successively smaller groups of pixels, in repeated steps, for the purpose of blurring it. It is named after German mathematician Johann Carl Friederich Gauss. This type of precise mathematical blurring is used extensively in artificially intelligent computer vision as a pre-processing step. For instance, when a digital photograph is blurred in this way, edges of objects are much easier to detect, enabling a computer to identify them automatically. How does it work? The 'pyramid' is constructed by repeatedly calculating a weighted average of the neighboring pixels of a source image and scaling the image down. It can be visualized by stacking progressively smaller versions of the image on top of one another. This process creates a pyramid shape in which the base of the pyramid is the original image, and the tip is a single pixel representing the average value of the entire image. Programming terms GCC Short for GNU Compiler Collection, GCC is a collection of programming compilers including C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada. Once installed, a basic C file, like the one shown on our C language page, can be compiled by running the command below. gcc -o test test.c In the example above, the GCC compiler uses test as the output file, test.c as the C file, and would create the file test.exe.

A good example of a general-purpose language is C. A language that is not a general-purposed language is called a DSL (domain-specific language). For example, HTML, Logo, MATLAB are examples of domain-specific languages. DSL, Programming terms Genetic programming Genetic programming is the process of enhancing computer programs using algorithms inspired by biological evolution. Programming languages that lend themselves naturally to genetic programming are those able to evaluate their own code natively. A classic example is Lisp, whose characteristic data structure is a list. Every Lisp program is written as a list, so Lisp programs are very good at manipulating and generating Lisp programs. How does it work? A genetic program starts with a set of instructions serving as the 'chromosomes,' and a 'fitness function' that determines which outcomes are ideal. The instructions are combined randomly to produce a first 'generation' of programs, and then those individual programs are tested for their fitness. The fittest programs — those that come closest to achieving the behavior defined by the fitness function — are selected for 'breeding.' The chromosomes of the fittest programs are combined, much like genetic code is combined in biological breeding. Some chromosomes are 'crossed over' (exchanged) with those in other programs, and some are 'mutated' — altered randomly in a predefined manner. Thousands or even millions of programs may be produced, with each generation coming closer and closer to achieving a desired result. Instructions, Programming terms GIGO GIGO may refer to any of the following: 1. With computer programming, GIGO is short for 'garbage in, garbage out' and is a program's inability to interpret any received bad data, resulting in incorrect results or a crash. For example, if a programmer instructed a program to access an improper section of memory, the returned data would be wrong and result in an error or crash the program. 2. GIGO is used to described any bad input that results in bad output. For example, if you were to phrase a computer question poorly, it would result in a wrong answer.

Code, Compatible, Programming terms Golang Go, also known as golang, is a computer programming language whose development began in 2007 at Google, and it was introduced to the public in 2009. Go's three lead developers at Google were Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Their goal was to create a language, loosely based on the syntax of the C programming language, which would eliminate the 'extraneous garbage' of languages such as C++. As a result, Go eschews many features of other modern languages, such as method and operator overloading, pointer arithmetic, and type inheritance. Go is not a free-form language: its conventions specify many formatting details, including how indentation and spaces are to be used. The language requires that none of its declared variables or imported libraries are unused, and all return statements are compulsory. Go employs 'type inference' in variable declarations: the variable type, rather than being an explicit part of the declaration statement, is inferred by the value type itself. For example, where in C an integer variable x could be set to the value 0 with the statement. int x = 0; In Go the equivalent statement would be: x := 0 The variable would be typed as an integer based on the value itself. Here is the classic 'Hello, World!' program, as written in Go: package main import 'fmt' func main()   fmt.Println('Hello, World')   Related pages The official Go website is https://golang.org. Programming language history. Programming language, Programming terms Goto Goto may refer to any of the following: 1. A programming statement that forwards a user to a different section of the program. Below is a basic example of how a goto may be used in Perl. Goto example use strict; start: print 'Please type your password: '; my $password = <STDIN>; if ($password =~ /secret/i)   print 'Success';   else   goto start;   In the above example, when the program is run, it would continue to prompt the user for a password until he or she enters secret as the password. To repeat the prompt a 'start:' label is placed at the start of the script and if 'secret' is not entered the script uses the goto statement to go to the start label and repeat the prompt. Tip Although a goto statement is an easy method of moving around a program, it is considered bad practice to use excessively because it creates spaghetti code. However, in some cases, a goto may be the only option or the best solution. We feel that it is best left to the programmer to decide when and when not to use the goto statement and stay away from the endless debate of using or not using goto statements in your code.

Programming terms Hash A hash may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to Perl, a hash is an associative array. In Perl, hashes are represented with the prefix %. They contain a listing of keys and values. Below is an example of a basic Perl hash. my %hope = ('hardware', 'Monitor', 'software', 'office'); print 'Hardware hash = $hope hardware  '; In the above example, the program sets the hash table and then prints the hardware hash, which is equal to the next element in the hash. Therefore, the program would print 'Hardware hash = Monitor' on the command line. 2. A hash is also another word for octothorpe ( # ). 3.

Database terms, Hashing, Hashtag, Percent, Programming terms Haskell Haskell is a programming language first introduced in 1990. It is a general-purpose language named after Haskell Curry, an American mathematician famous for his contributions to the field of combinatory logic. Haskell's features Lazy evaluation — Haskell only evaluates expressions when the value is actually needed for a calculation. It was one of the first languages to employ this type of evaluation strategy. Previous to Haskell, most programming languages used 'eager evaluation,' in which an expression is evaluated as soon as it is bound to a variable. Lazy evaluation can offer better performance, and permits the definition of data structures that have no size limit. Pure functions — In Haskell, functions are 'pure,' meaning they are guaranteed to always return, given the same input. The return value of a function never varies due to the changing state of information outside of the function and cannot have side effects on data outside the scope of the function. This restriction has the benefit of simplifying debugging, and making it easier to predict a program's real-world behavior. Strong, static typing — Once a variable is declared as a certain data type in Haskell, it cannot be used as if it were another data type. This limitation requires a more stringent programming style, but allows for performance benefits of the compiled code. Haskell 98 , which was released in late 1997, included a special standard library for teaching purposes and a framework for future extensions. , which was released in late 1997, included a special standard library for teaching purposes and a framework for future extensions.

Cloud, Programming terms Heuristic evaluation A heuristic evaluation is a method of testing a computer program to identify problems in the user interface design. It is one way of measuring how well a human user can interact with the computer while utilizing a certain piece of software. The method was developed by Jakob Nielsen, a consultant in the field of usability engineering. Heuristic evaluations principles Visibility of system status - The software should always keep the user aware of what is going on, and provide feedback to user actions within a reasonable period of time. Correspondence between the system and the real world - The software should 'speak the user's language' - it should use words, phrases, and concepts that are familiar to the user. Information should be presented using real-world conventions, in a logical and intelligible order. User control and freedom - Users who make a mistake by using the program incorrectly should have a clearly marked 'emergency exit' to leave the unwanted state without extensive inconvenience. The program should support undo and redo functionality. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Established conventions should be followed. Error prevention - Conditions that may produce an error should be anticipated and handled intelligently. The user should be given a confirmation message if the action they are about to take might produce an error. Recognition rather than recall - The user should have to remember the fewest things possible to use the program efficiently. Objects, actions, and options should be made visible whenever possible. Instructions for how to use the system should be visible or easily retrievable. Flexibility and efficiency of use - The system should cater to experienced users, giving them the option to accelerate use of the system through shortcuts or macros. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogs should not contain irrelevant or obscure information. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be phrased in helpful language as opposed to error codes. Errors should be precisely identified and indicated, with constructive suggestions for a solution. Help and documentation - Documentation should be easy to search, focused on the user's perspective, list concrete steps to be taken, and not be too large. In the evaluation process, each of these heuristics is usually associated with a numeric value, and users are asked to provide feedback, rating each aspect of the user experience. This feedback is then provided to developers, to help them improve the software. Programming terms, Test, User experience Hex editor A hex editor is a computer program that allows users to edit the binary code, represented by hexadecimal values, which makes up a computer file. Using a hex editor you can view and edit the raw file data, making modifications down to the core programming of the software application. Many free hex editors are available for download. Features range from simple to complex. While some provide only a raw look at the binary code, some provide a rich set of tools for interpreting and editing the data. Hiew, Programming terms Hiew Hiew (hacker's view) is a hex editor console for Windows. Developed by Eugene Suslikov, it includes the following features: Built-in assembler and disassembler for x86, x86-64, and ARMv6. A built-in calculator. Pattern searching when run in disassembler mode. Support for files of nearly any size. 64-bit, Assembler, Hexadecimal, Programming terms, Security terms High-level language Sometimes abbreviated as HLL, a high-level language is a computer programming language that isn't limited by the computer, designed for a specific job, and is easier to understand. It is more like human language and less like machine language. However, for a computer to understand and run a program created with a high-level language, it must be compiled into machine language. The first high-level languages were introduced in the 1950s. Today, high-level languages are in widespread use. These include BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Java, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Visual Basic.

HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another. HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images so that your Internet browser may display them as they are intended to look. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance). What does an HTML tag look like? As can be seen in the HTML tag example above, there are not many components. Almost all HTML tags have an opening tag that contains the name with any attributes, a close tag that contains a forward slash, and the name of the tag that is being closed. For tags that do not have a closing tag like <img>, it is best practice to end the tag with a forward slash. Each tag is contained within a less than and greater than angle brackets, and everything between the opening and closing tag is displayed or affected by the tag. In the example above, the <a> tag is creating a link called 'Computer Hope' that is pointing to the hope.html file. Tip See our HTML and Web Design Help page for a full listing of HTML tags. What does HTML look like? The following is an example of a basic web page written in HTML as well as a description of each section and its function. <!DOCType HTML PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN' 'https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd'> <html> <head> <title>Example page</title> <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=windows-1252'> </head> <body> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is an example of a basic HTML page.</p> </body> </html> The box above contains the key ingredients to a basic web page. The first line (DOCType) describes what version of HTML the page was written in so that an Internet browser can interpret the text that follows. Next, the HTML opening tag lets the browser know that it is reading HTML code. The HTML tag is followed by the head section which contains information about the page such as its title, meta tags, and where to locate the CSS file. The body section is all content that is viewable on the browser. For example, all the text you see here is contained within the body tags. Finally, closing tags wrap each element for proper syntax. See our HTML and Web Design Help for a full listing of HTML tags. What is HTML5? HTML5 is the update made to HTML from HTML4 (XHTML follows a different version numbering scheme). It uses the same basic rules as HTML4, but adds some new tags and attributes which allow for better semantics and for dynamic elements that are activated using JavaScript. New elements include section, <article>, <aside>, <audio>, <bdi>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <footer>, <header>, <keygen>, <mark>, <meter>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <rp>, <rt>, <ruby>, <time>, <track>, <video>, and <wbr>. There are also new input types for forms, which include tel, search, url, email, datetime, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. With the increasing movement to keep structure and style separate, a number of styling elements have been removed along with those that had accessibility issues or saw very little use. These following elements should no longer be used in HTML code: <acronym>, <applet>, <basefont>, <big>, <center>, <dir>, <font>, <frame>, <frameset>, <noframes>, <strike>, and <tt>. HTML5 also simplifies the doctype declaration to the tag in the following box. <!doctype html> What does HTML5 look like? As shown below the HTML5 code is very similar to the earlier HTML4 example, but is cleaner and has a revised doctype tag. <!doctype html> <html> <head> <meta charset='utf-8'> <title>Example page</title> </head> <body> <h1>This is a heading</h1> <p>This is an example of a basic HTML page.</p> </body> </html> How to create and view HTML Because HTML is a markup language, it can be created and viewed in any text editor as long as it is saved with a .htm or .html file extension. However, most find it easier to design and create web pages in HTML using an HTML editor. Once the HTML file is created it can be viewed locally or uploaded to a web server to be viewed online using a browser. Which file extensions are used with HTML? HTML files use either the .htm or .html file extension. Older versions of Windows (Windows 3.x) only allow three-letter file extensions, so they used .htm instead of .html. However, both file extensions have the same meaning, and either may be used today. That being said, we recommend sticking to one naming convention as certain web servers may prefer one extension over the other. Note Web pages that are created using a scripting language like Perl, PHP, or Python have a different extension even though they only show HTML in the source code. How to pronounce HTML HTML is pronounced as h-t-m-l (aitch-tee-em-el). Tip Because of the vowel sound when pronouncing HTML, you would use 'an' instead of 'a' in front of the abbreviation in your writing.

It was originally proposed by Charles Simonyi, a programmer at Xerox PARC in the early 1980s. There are two variations of Hungarian notation: Systems and Apps. They both involve using a special prefix as part of the name to indicate an object's nature. Systems Hungarian notation In Systems Hungarian notation, the prefix represents the actual data type of the object. For instance, if the object named Greeting were a zero-terminated string, its Systems Hungarian name might be szGreeting. Or, if the object YesOrNo were a boolean variable, its Systems Hungarian name would be bYesOrNo. Apps Hungarian notation In Apps Hungarian notation, the prefix represents the logical data type, which gives an indication of the object's purpose. For instance, an 'unsafe' string (a string that needs to be sanitized before it is used) might have the prefix us, and a variable used for counting might be prefixed with n. Hungarian notation prefixes The prefix used is up to the programmer, but standard prefixes include: b for boolean ch for char w for word dw for double word i for integer f or fp for floating-point d or db for double-precision floating point p for pointer u32 for unsigned 32-bit integer fn for function Programming terms Hwclock Hwclock is an UNIX and Linux command for accessing the computer's hardware clock, which is a battery-powered clock on the system's motherboard. The battery ensures that even if the computer loses power, the time will not have to be reset when the computer is powered back on. When the operating system loads, it keeps a record of the time, which may or may not be set according to the system's hardware clock. As an alternative, it may set the time according to a network time server. Tip The system's hardware clock can also be set using the system BIOS configuration tool. Clock, Programming terms, System BIOS Was this page useful? IDE IDE may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for Integrated Drive Electronics, IDE is more commonly known as ATA or PATA (parallel ATA). It is a standard interface for IBM computers that was first developed by Western Digital and Compaq in 1986 for compatible hard drives and CD or DVD drives. IDE is different than SCSI and ESDI (Enhanced Small Disk Interface) because its controllers are on each drive, meaning the drive can connect directly to the motherboard or controller. IDE and its updated successor, EIDE (Enhanced IDE), are common drive interfaces found in IBM compatible computers. Below is a picture of the IDE connector on the back of a hard drive, a picture of what an IDE cable looks like, and the IDE channels it connects to on the motherboard. Note The location of the 1 pin (first pin) on an IDE cable is usually designated by the red stripe on one side of the cable. In the example picture above, the 1 pin is on the right side of the cable. How many drives can each IDE channel support? Each IDE channel can support two drives. A single IDE ribbon cable has three connection. One connection connects to the motherboard and the other two connections are available for the two drives. 2. Alternatively referred to as IDLE, IDE is short for integrated development environment, and are visual tools that allow programmers to develop programs more efficiently. Commonly, an IDE may have a compiler, debugger, text editor, and other integrated tools. Smalltalk was the first programming language to have a first true IDE.

An operation is idempotent if it can be repeated multiple times and always provide the same result, with no side effects to other objects in the system. It is an important concept in many functional programming languages and database systems. The term was coined by mathematical philosopher Benjamin Peirce in his self-published 1870 book, Linear Associative Algebra. Related pages How do I create a computer program?

A typical if else statement would appear similar to the one below (this example is JavaScript, and would be very similar in other C-style languages). var x = 1; if (x === 1)   window.alert('The expression is true!');   else   window.alert('The expression is false!');   In this case, with the variable x being equal to the number 1, the statement in the first set of curly braces    is executed. You would receive a pop-up 'The expression is true!' alert message. If you were to change the first line of the above code to var x = 42;, you would receive a pop-up alert message with the text 'The expression is false!' Conditional expression, Else, Else if, If statement, Programming terms, Switch statement, Ternary operator If statement An if statement is a programming conditional statement that, if proved true, performs a function or displays information. Below is a general example of an if statement, not specific to any particular programming language. if (X < 10)   print 'Hello John';   In the example above, if the value of X were equal to any number less than 10, the program would print, or display, 'Hello John' on the console when the script is run.

Conditional expression, Else, Elseif, Exists, If else, Programming terms Intermediate language An intermediate language is an abstract programming language used by a compiler as an in-between step when translating a computer program into machine code. Before compiling the program into code for an actual, physical machine, the compiler first translates it into intermediate code suitable for a theoretical, abstract machine. This code is analyzed by the compiler, and if any opportunities for optimization are identified the compiler can perform the optimizations when making the translation into assembly language. Compiler, Machine code, Optimization, Programming terms Immutable object In computer programming, an immutable object is an object that the programmer cannot change after creating it. Immutable objects are primarily found in functional and object-oriented programming languages. Benefits of using immutable objects Higher security — an object cannot be altered cannot be used for a purpose other than its original intent. Thread safety — in a multi-threaded program, immutable data cannot be incidentally overwritten by another concurrent thread. Simplicity — it is easier to debug and analyze a program's behavior if a large set of objects remain the same throughout the program's execution. Object-oriented programming, Programming terms Imperative programming Imperative programming is a paradigm of computer programming in which the program describes a sequence of steps that change the state of the computer. Unlike declarative programming, which describes 'what' a program should accomplish, imperative programming explicitly tells the computer 'how' to accomplish it. Programs written this way often compile to binary executables that run more efficiently since all CPU instructions are themselves imperative statements. To make programs simpler for a human to read and write, imperative statements can be grouped into sections known as code blocks. In the 1950s, the idea of grouping a program's code into blocks was first implemented in the ALGOL programming language. They were originally called 'compound statements,' but today these blocks of code are known as procedures. Once a procedure is defined, it can be used as a single imperative statement, abstracting the control flow of a program and allowing the developer to express programming ideas more naturally. This type of imperative programming is called procedural programming, and it is a step towards higher-level abstractions such as declarative programming. Imperative programming languages Declarative programming, Language, Paradigm, Procedural language, Programming language, Programming terms Implicit parallelism A programming language is said to be implicitly parallel if its compiler or interpreter can recognize opportunities for parallelization and implement them without being told to do so. Example of implicit parallelism Imagine that you have an array of numbers, and you need to find the square root of each number. It might be efficient to parallelize an operation like this across multiple cores. If you had to write special code that directly instructs the computer to parallelize, it would be an example of explicit parallelism. Implicit parallelism is where the language notices that you are taking a lot of square roots and parallelizes the process for you behind the scenes. Implicitly parallel programming languages Microsoft Axum MATLAB's M-code ZPL LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench). NESL SISAL HPF (High-Performance Fortran). Fortran, MATLAB, Parallelization, Programming, Programming terms Increment An increment may refer to any of the following: 1. The process of increasing or decreasing a numeric value by another value. For example, incrementing 2 to 10 by the number 2 would be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. 2. An increment is also a programming operator to increase the value of a numerical value. In Perl, a variable can be incremented by one by adding a ++ at the end of the variable. In the example below, the value variable is set as 1 and then incremented in value by one with the $value++; line. Therefore, when this variable is printed it prints 2. my $value = 1; $value++; print '$value '; Decrement, Incremental backup, Operator, Plus, Programming terms, Tabulator Inherent error An inherent error is an error found in a program that causes it to fail regardless of what the user does and is commonly unavoidable. This error requires the programmer or software developer to modify the code to correct the issue. Error, Programming terms Inheritance In object-oriented programming, inheritance refers to the ability of an object to take on one or more characteristics from other classes of objects. The characteristics inherited are usually instance variables or member functions. An object that inherits these characteristics is known as a subclass, and the object it inherits them from is known as a superclass. The details of how inheritance is implemented vary between languages, but the first language to implement it was Simula in 1967. What is inheritance used for? The purpose of inheritance is to consolidate and re-use code. For example, if the objects car, truck, and motorcycle are subclasses of the superclass vehicle, code that applies to all of them can be consolidated into a vehicle superclass. The subclasses will inherit this code and any future changes made to it, automatically. Five types of inheritance Single inheritance - Subclasses inherit characteristics from a single superclass. - Subclasses inherit characteristics from a single superclass. Multiple inheritance - A subclass may have more than one superclass and inherit characteristics from all of them. - A subclass may have more than one superclass and inherit characteristics from all of them. Multilevel inheritance - A subclass may have its own subclasses. In other words, a subclass of a superclass can itself be a superclass to other subclasses. - A subclass may have its own subclasses. In other words, a subclass of a superclass can itself be a superclass to other subclasses. Hierarchical inheritance - A base class acts as the parent superclass to multiple levels of subclasses. - A base class acts as the parent superclass to multiple levels of subclasses. Hybrid inheritance - A combination of one or more of the other inheritance types. Instance, Object-oriented, Programming terms Inline Alternatively referred to as in-line, inline is any element contained within a program, document, or message. For example, with HTML, inline code is anything that is built into the web page, instead of being loaded from an external file. The majority of content seen on this page is inline, but the images and CSS file are external. When referring to how HTML or CSS is displayed, an inline element refers to an element that stays in the same line as the code that surrounds the text. For example, the bolded text of 'in-line' and 'inline' in the above paragraph are both inline elements. Examples of CSS inline elements <a> - Create an anchor. <abbr> - Create an acronym or abbreviation. <acronym> - Create an acronym. <audio> - Embed sound files. <b> - Bold text. <bdi> - Confine text that may be formatted differently. <bdo> - Force text to go one way or another. <big> - Make text bigger. <blink> - Make text blink. <br> - Create a line break. <button> - Create a form button. <cite> - Mention any creative work. <code> - Designate text as code. <del> - Delete or strikethrough text. <dfn> - Represent the defining instance of a term. <em> - Give emphasis to text. <font> - Change the font. <i> - Italicizes text. <img> - Show an image file. <input> - Create an input box on a form. <ins> - Insert text. <kbd> - Indicate text was inserted using a keyboard. <mark> - Highlight text. <meter> - Create a meter. <output> - Show result of a user's action or a calculation. <progress> - Display the progress of a task. <q> - Designate text as a short quotation. <rp> - Designate parenthesis for browsers without Ruby annotations. <rt> - Designate the pronunciation of an East Asian word. <ruby> - Designate a ruby annotation on a web page. <s> - Strikethrough text. <samp> - Designate sample output from a computer <select> - Drop-down menu for form field <small> - Make text smaller. <span> - Container for grouping or phrasing content. <strike> - Strikethrough text. <strong> - Mark text with a strong importance. <sub> - Create subscript text. <sup> - Make text superscript. <strong> - Give strong importance to text. <textarea> - Create text area for form. <time> - Designate a date and time that are readable by humans. <tt> - Make text teletype text. <u> - Underline text. <var> - Define text as a variable. <video> - Show a video file. <wbr> - Break a line of text. External, HTML, Internal, Programming terms, Web design terms Instance An instance may refer to any of the following: 1. In programming, an instance is one occurrence of a class or object. For example, a program may have a class/object named Animal, but there could be many instances of Animal, such as lion, cat, and dog. An example using JavaScript is shown below where the Animal object is created, followed by three instances. function Animal(numlegs, mysound)   this.legs = numlegs; this.sound = mysound;   var lion = new Animal(4, 'roar'); var cat = new Animal(4, 'meow'); var dog = new Animal(4, 'bark'); The Animal object allows for the number of legs and the sound the animal makes to be set by each instance of the object. In this case, all three instances (lion, cat, and dog) have the same number of legs, but make different sounds. This process allows for items of similar structure, or that perform similar functions to reuse code, rather than duplicating it. 2. When referring to MMORPGs, an instance is a location created for a single player or group of players. This process allows multiple groups of players to run through the same content, without having to wait for another group to finish. Class, Game terms, Object, Programming terms, Subroutine, Zone Instantiation In computer science, instantiation is the realization of a predefined object. In OOP (object-oriented programming), a class of object may be defined. All objects of this class have a certain set of properties (associated variables), accessories (ways to access those variables), and methods (functions). An instance of that object may then be declared, giving it a unique, named identity so that it may be used in the program. This process is called 'instantiation.' The term 'instantiation' is also used in other areas of computer science, such as in the creation of virtual servers. The virtual server's properties (disk space, allocated RAM, type of operating system, installed software, etc.) are defined beforehand. Then, multiple servers can be virtualized on a single machine, each using that configuration. The process of virtualizing them is referred to as instantiation, and each virtual server is called an instance. Related pages How do I create a computer program?

The number 0 is also considered an integer even though it has neither a positive or negative value. In most programming languages, you can convert a number into an integer using the int function. The int function in Perl Below is some code written in the Perl programming language.

Instead, another program, called an interpreter, reads the program and executes it on the fly. Benefits of compiling vs. interpreting programs A compiled program generally performs better for the end user, because its machine code can be highly optimized during the compilation process. In contrast, interpreted languages can offer unique benefits to the programmer. One example is a REPL, which allows the programmer to interact with the program while it is being written. Many computer languages can be either compiled or interpreted. For instance, the C programming language is usually compiled, but interpreters for C are available. JavaScript is generally considered to be an interpreted language, where the client (usually a web browser) is the interpreter. However, in most modern browsers, some form of JIT is used to compile JavaScript code before it runs. Lisp, which is often considered an interpreted language, can mix interpreted code and compiled bytecode in a single program. Examples of interpreted languages Common examples of interpreted programming languages include: BASIC Bash Excel formulas Forth Perl PostScript PowerShell Scheme Tcl VBScript Compiled, Literal string, Programming terms Invalid Error message generated by invalid data, a logical programming flaw, or an input error.

As of 2017, 24 IOCCC competitions have taken place, with 2018 suggested as the likely year of the 25th competition. An example of a winning program is 'duble,' winner of the 2015 prize for 'best handwriting.'

Short for interprocess communication, IPC is the ability of applications to share information and handle many requests at one time. An example of IPC is DDE (dynamic data exchange) where information modified in one application is automatically updated in another. 2. Short for instructions per cycle, IPC is a measurement of how many instructions a CPU can execute in a single clock cycle. IPC fluctuates depending on the needs and design of the software being run on the CPU. Modern high-performance CPUs can execute as many as 64 IPC. Computer acronyms, Hidden share, Programming terms ISAPI Short for Internet Server Application Program Interface, ISAPI is a Microsoft API similar to CGI scripts for programmers to create web-based scripts and programs on IIS and similar servers. Computer acronyms, Programming terms Iteration With respect to computing, iteration is the process of going through a set of operations that deal with computer code. For example, in a computer program, one form of iteration is a loop. A loop repeats code until a certain condition is met. Each time the computer runs through a loop, it is referred to as an iteration. Many computer programs and programming languages use iterations to perform specific tasks, solve problems, and present solutions. Programming terms Java Champion A Java Champion is an elected member of the Java Champions; a program sponsored by Oracle to recognize leaders in the Java software development community.

Java, Oracle, Programming terms Java Originally known as oak, Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and others at Sun Microsystems. It was first introduced to the public in 1995 and is widely used to create Internet applications and other software programs. Today, Java is maintained and owned by Oracle. When used on the Internet, Java allows applets to be downloaded and used through a browser, which enables the browser to perform a function or feature not normally available. Unlike JavaScript, the users must download or install the applet or program before being able to utilize the Java program. Below is an example of a Java applet from Sun and a method of testing if Java is installed on your computer. If Java is installed on your computer, you should see additional information about the installed Java version and your operating system. Java is also used as the programming language for many different software programs, games, and add-ons.

JavaScript is an interpreted client-side scripting language that allows a web designer the ability to insert code into their web page. JavaScript is commonly placed into an HTML or ASP file and runs directly from the web page and today is the most popular programming language. JavaScript can be used to perform more advanced tasks such as printing the time and date, creating a calendar, or other tasks that are not possible in HTML. What is required to run JavaScript? JavaScript only requires an Internet browser with JavaScript enabled, which all browsers have by default. Is JavaScript safe? Because JavaScript is downloaded from an unknown origin and executed on your computer, JavaScript could have the potential of being a virus or doing other malicious things to your computer. To address this issue, Sun implemented tight security features from the earlier stages of development. These features include: When the browser runs the JavaScript, it is isolated to the browser process. Browsers like Chrome and Edge will sandbox JavaScript as an additional security measure. JavaScript cannot read from or write to the hard drive or another storage device connected to the computer. However, even with the above safety measures, anything connected to the Internet is never 100% safe and it is possible for a computer to be compromised using JavaScript. To help possible security breaches JavaScript can be disabled. However, most sites today require JavaScript to be fully operational. Alternatively, you can make sure to always make sure you're running the latest version of your browser to help keep safe. There are also browser add-ons that can be installed to help control JavaScript or its features on websites. Are Java and JavaScript the same thing? No. Java and JavaScript are two different computer programming languages with a few similarities. If you want to learn one of the languages and want to develop features for the Internet and websites, you should learn JavaScript. If you want to develop applications (e.g., a game that runs on a computer or smartphone without the need of a browser) you should learn Java. See our Java definition for further information about Java. Hello, World! in JavaScript <SCRIPT LANGUAGE='JavaScript'> <! -- Hide from old browsers document.write('Hello World!'); // Stop hide --> </SCRIPT> Tip With HTML5, you no longer need to specify the language attribute. Live example of JavaScript Below is an example of a JavaScript implemented into this page that will print the current time and date. Like all JavaScript files, the user's Internet browser must be capable of viewing JavaScript and the execution of JavaScript must be enabled. If JavaScript is not enabled, the time and date will not be visible. Tip See the JavaScript time and date source code to use these JavaScript features in a web page. Although JavaScript files are often embedded into the HTML file, users can also save their JavaScript code in an external file. This file often ends with a .js file extension.

The JSON format was specified by Douglas Crockford. JSON is based on the JavaScript programming language, but can be used in most other languages by using a special JSON parser. It is an alternative to XML for gathering data. Below is an example of JSON data:   'Name' : 'Ed', 'Career' : 'Teacher'   Basically, JSON formats data into JavaScript objects and allows for name and value pairs, arrays, strings, and other data types. When this data is read by a JSON parser, it is converted into the appropriate data type in the programming language being used for quick retrieval of data. When saving JSON data, the file extension used is .json. Related pages For more information on JSON, visit the JSON website.

It was founded in 2014 by Colombian physicist and software developer Fernando Pérez, as a language-agnostic version of the IPython (interactive Python) project. Jupyter provides tools for mathematicians, scientists, students, data analysts, and computing professionals to write code interactively, view real time results, and publish results on the web. Jupyter Notebook Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment and Python web server, providing a browser-based UI (user interface) for Jupyter users. Jupyter Notebooks are an ordered list of input/output cells, each providing a REPL (read-eval-print loopread-eval-print loop) for writing code and a window to show output in real time. The picture is an example of a Jupyter Notebook interface, displaying a Python program that uses Pythreejs (a Python interface for Threejs, a JavaScript 3-D graphics library). The 3-D objects in the output window update immediately when changes to the code are saved. In addition to code, Jupyter Notebooks may contain text (written in the Markdown format), and rich media, such as audio and video. The Jupyter Notebooks are stored internally as JSON files, and have the file extension .ipynb. A next-generation UI for Jupyter Notebooks, called JupyterLab, is currently in development, with a stable version released in 2018. Jupyter kernels Jupyter kernels are modular kernels that interpret the code in Jupyter Notebooks. As of May 2019, over 100 kernels are available or in active development, each supporting one specific programming language, with a handful of exceptions. Languages with Jupyter kernels include Python, R, Julia, Haskell, Ruby, Fortran, Perl, Go, Scala, Erlang, Elixir, OCaml, PHP, Octave, MATLAB, C, Racket, Scheme, Bash, and PowerShell. Jupyter kernels use ZeroMQ, an asynchronous messaging library, to interface with Juypter Notebook components concurrently, enabling high scalability and non-blocking I/O. JupyterHub JupyterHub is a multi-user service for Jupyter Notebooks, providing collaboration tools and the ability to allow multiple Jupyter Notebooks to interact with one another. Cloud services Organizations that don't want to administer a JupyterHub can host their Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud. Cloud services that support Jupyter include: Amazon SageMaker Notebooks - available on AWS (Amazon Web Services). - available on AWS (Amazon Web Services). Google Colaboratory - available on GCP (Google Cloud Platform). - available on GCP (Google Cloud Platform). Microsoft Azure Notebook - available on Microsoft Azure.

In general, a label is a sticker placed on a floppy diskette drive, hard drive, CD-ROM or other equipment that contains printed information to help identify that object or its data. 2. In a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel, a label is text within a cell, usually describing data in the rows or columns surrounding it. 3. When referring to a chart, a label is any text over a section of a chart that gives additional information about the charts value. For example, in our pie chart example each section of the pie chart is labeled to give the value of each percentage. 4. When referring to HTML, the <label> tag is used to create labels for items in a user interface. 5. In programming, a label is either a reference point or command used to move throughout a program. See the goto definition for an example of how this may be used. 6. Label is also an MS-DOS and Windows command line instruction used to change the identity of a hard or floppy disk drive. Control flow, Disk envelope, HTML, Programming terms, Spreadsheet terms, User interface Lambda calculus First developed by American mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s, lambda calculus is a formal system for expressing computation based on the abstraction of functions. It is a foundational principle in mathematical logic. More plainly, lambda calculus aims to be a simple system of computation that is an alternative to the 'hardware' approach used by Turing machines. How is lambda calculus used? In computer programming, lambda calculus is used to anonymize functions, allowing them to be referred to in the abstract sense. This action makes them first-class objects, allowing them to be operated on like any other entity in the language. For example, an anonymous function can be passed to other functions as a parameter. One of the first programming languages to use anonymous functions was LISP. The special word lambda in LISP defines a function without giving it a name. For instance, the function x + 2 can be defined anonymously in LISP with the following statement: (lambda (x) (+ x 2)) Anonymous functions are an important part of many modern programming languages, including JavaScript. Knights of Lambda Calculus, Logic, Programming terms, Syntactic sugar Language processor A language processor is a software program designed or used to perform tasks such as processing program code to machine code. Language processors are found in languages such as Fortran and COBOL. Examples of language processors There are two main types of language processors: Interpreter - allows a computer to interpret, or understand, what a software program needs the computer to do, what tasks to perform. - allows a computer to interpret, or understand, what a software program needs the computer to do, what tasks to perform. Translator - takes a program's code and translates it into machine code, allowing the computer to read and understand what tasks the program needs to be done in its native code. An assembler and a compiler are examples of translators. The difference between an interpreter and a translator is that an interpreter is telling the computer what to do. A translator takes the program's code and converts it to machine code, allowing the computer to read it. Essentially, the interpreter tells the computer what to do and the translator lets the computer figure out what to do by itself. Language, Programming terms Language Language may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to a language that computers speaks, binary is the lowest form of language understood by computers. 2. When referring to a language a human can use to communicate with a computer, a programming language is used to communicate instructions to for a computer to perform. 3. When referring to a selection in a program, a language refers to what language the user of the computer speaks or prefers. For example, English may be an option. Language processor, Programming terms Less than Alternatively referred to as an angle bracket, the less than is a symbol ( < ) that is found on all computer keyboards, commonly the same key as the comma. The less than symbol resembles an arrow pointing to the left and is commonly used in math and computer programming. Tip The wide edge of the less than symbol always faces to the larger number. For example, with 1 < 5 you know one is less than five. Where is the less than on the keyboard? Below is an overview of a computer keyboard with the less than key highlighted in blue. How to create a less than Creating the < symbol on a U.S. keyboard On English PC and Mac keyboards, the less than is on the same key as the comma. Pressing and holding down the Shift key while pressing the less than key creates the less than symbol. Creating the < symbol on a smartphone or tablet To create a less than symbol on a smartphone or tablet open the keyboard and go into the numbers (123) and then (#+=) or symbols (sym) section and then press your finger on the < symbol. What is a less than used for on a computer? Below is an example of how the less than could be used in math. In the example below, the statement is showing that 2 is less than 10. 2 < 10 Finally, below is an example of how the less than could be used in computer programming. In this example, the if statement is performed if the variable $myvalue is less than 100. If the variable was greater than 100, this section of code would be skipped. if ($myvalue < 100)   print 'Less than 100. ';   Greater than, Keyboard terms, Less than or equal to Lexical analysis In computer science, lexical analysis is the process of converting a sequence of characters into meaningful strings; these meaningful strings are referred to as tokens. A program that performs lexical analysis is called a lexical analyzer, lexer, or tokenizer. This program is often used in conjunction with a software component (called a parser) that converts the string into structured data. Where is lexical analysis used? Lexical analysis and parsing are used by programs like compilers that can use the parsed data from a programmer's code to create a compiled binary executable. They are also used by web browsers to format and display a web page by using data parsed from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Code, Compiler, Computer science, Executable, Programming terms Library A library may refer to any of the following: 1. In computer programming, a library refers to a collection of files, programs, routines, scripts, or functions that can be referenced in the programming code. 2. In Windows 7, there are 5 default Libraries. Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos. They contain links to each of these libraries for the user to have easy access to the contents of each library. Related pages How do I add a Library to Windows 7? 3. When referring to data-storage, a library refers to any managed collection of storage devices, often a collection of removable storage. Programming terms Life cycle When referring to a development, product, service, or support, the life cycle is the series of stages that it goes through during its creation. For example, with software, the life cycle is the steps the software goes through that include the development, testing, and finally the release of the product. What is a software release life cycle? As computer software is developed, it goes through a software release life cycle, which is a series of steps followed to help make sure a quality product gets released. See our software development process page for further information on the software release life cycle. What is the support life cycle? A support life cycle is the length of time a company supports a product or service. For example, the mainstream support life cycle of Microsoft Windows 7 was until January 13, 2015, and the extended support life cycle is until January 14, 2020. A company may extend the life cycle of their products (as Microsoft did with Windows XP) due to the number of people still using it that may still need support and updates. Microsoft even released updates to a very serious security vulnerability in Windows XP in 2019 (18 years after it was first released). What is a product life cycle? When selling a product, the PLC (product life cycle) is the following stages of the product while on the market. Introduction The first stage of a product life cycle is the introduction of the product. This stage involves the marketing and branding of the product. Growth Next, the growth stage involves maintaining and improving the quality of the product, improving the distribution, and marketing the product to new audiences. Maturity After growing the product, the next stage is maintaining the maturity of the product by keeping the price competitive, adding new features, and promoting the product. Decline The final stage happens when the product's business begins to decline. In this stage, a company may decide to remove features not being used, cut the production and distribution costs, or consider discontinuing the product or selling its rights. Business terms, Discontinue, EOL, Programing terms, Software, Software terms, Technology Linker In computer science, a linker is a computer program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into one, executable program. Computer programs are usually made up of multiple modules that span separate object files, each being a compiled computer program. The program as a whole refers to these separately compiled object files using symbols. The linker combines these separate files into a single, unified program; resolving the symbolic references as it goes along. Dynamic linking is a similar process, available on many operating systems, which postpones the resolution of some symbols until the program is executed. When the program is run, these dynamic link libraries are loaded as well. Dynamic linking does not require a linker. The linker bundled with most Linux systems is called ld; see our ld documentation page for more information. Executable, Module, Object file, Programming, Programming terms Lisp Short for List Processing, Lisp is a high-level programming language created by John McCarthy and used in artificial intelligence research starting in 1958.

Once MacPorts is installed, open the Terminal, and run sudo port install clisp to start the install. Windows computer users To install Lisp on a PC running Windows, visit the ANSI Common Lisp SourceForge site, and download the latest version of Clisp. For example, if you were getting version 2.49 you would open the 2.49 folder and download and install the clisp-2.49-win32-mingw-big.exe file. Linux computer users To install Lisp on a Linux computer, visit the Linux package page for your distribution of Linux at the http://clisp.org/ website. Should I use 'Lisp' or 'LISP' in my writing? When LISP 1 was first introduced, it was written as all uppercase. Today, Lisp is written as proper case with a capital 'L' and lowercase 'isp.' Unless you're writting about the early versions of LISP, you should be using 'Lisp' in your writing. AI, Artificial intelligence terms, CLOS, Computer acronyms, Programming language, Programming terms, Special purpose language Literal string A literal string may refer to any of the following: 1. Alternatively referred to as a literal(s), a literal string is a series of characters enclosed in double or single quotes (or both) depending on the programming language or command line. When a string of characters is treated as literal, the program will not try to interpret anything in the string until it encounters the next double or single quote. For example, in Perl using the command below, it would print 'Hello World! Here is a $1.' print 'Hello World! Here is a $1'; However, if that same string is surrounded with double quotes instead of single quotes, Perl would try to interpret the $1 as a variable unless the dollar sign is escaped, as shown below. print 'Hello World! Here is a  $1'; The same is true if you want to add a variable to a string. In the example below, the variable $name is assigned 'Nathan' and the first print using a single quote is treated as a literal string, which means it would print 'Hello $name'. However, the second print with double quotes is an interpreted string and would print 'Hello Nathan'. use strict; my $name = 'Nathan'; print 'Hello $name'; print 'Hello $name'; Tip With both literal and interpreted strings, if you need to put a quote in the string, it needs to be escaped if it is the same quote used to start the string. 2. When connected to an FTP session, the literal command sends a literal string to the connected computer and expects a one-line response. See the 'How to use FTP' for information about literal and other FTP commands. Machine language, Programming terms, Variable LiveScript LiveScript is the beginning language for what we now know as JavaScript, renamed in 1995 after Sun endorsed the language. JavaScript, Programming terms LLVM LLVM is a compiler infrastructure used to optimize code for a number of different programming languages. It provides re-usable 'toolchain technologies' that can process the intermediate form of a program during the compilation process. This utility allows LLVM to analyzing a program for optimization opportunities and provides modified intermediate form to the compiler itself. Originally, LLVM was short for Low Level Virtual Machine when it began in 2000, but since then it has grown in scope and the name no longer stands for anything in particular. LLVM is used by Apple in all its development tools for OS X and iOS, and by Sony for development on the PlayStation 4. Supported LLVM languages Languages that can be optimized using LLVM include: Optimization, Programming terms Local optimum In mathematics and computer science, a local optimum is the best solution to a problem within a small neighborhood of possible solutions. This concept is in contrast to the global optimum, which is the optimal solution when every possible solution is considered. When developing an algorithm to solve a problem, heuristics such as simulated annealing may be used to minimize solutions that are optimal locally, but not globally. Computer Science, Programming terms Logic programming Logic programming is a computer programming paradigm in which program statements express facts and rules about problems within a system of formal logic. Rules are written as logical clauses with a head and a body; for instance, 'H is true if B1, B2, and B3 are true.' Facts are expressed similar to rules, but without a body; for instance, 'H is true.' Some logic programming languages such as Datalog and ASP (Answer Set Programming) are purely declarative — they allow for statements about what the program should accomplish, with no explicit step-by-step instructions about how to do so. Others, such as Prolog, are a combination of declarative and imperative — they may also include procedural statements such as 'To solve H, solve B1, B2, and B3.'

It is most often used to test whether a certain relationship between the phrases is true or false. In computing, logical operations are necessary because they can be used to model the way that information flows through electrical circuits, such as the circuits inside a CPU. These types of operations are called Boolean operations. The elements in a circuit which behave according to Boolean logic are called logic gates. Fundamental logic operations The following seven logic operations take inputs that are either true (1) or false (0) and produce a single output value that is also true or false. Most of these operations can take more than two inputs, except for the NOT operation which takes only one input. Below are examples using only one or two inputs, which is what usually happens inside a computer. The operations are listed below. Click on a link for an operation to learn more. AND The AND logic operation returns true only if either of its inputs are true. If either of the inputs is false, the output is also false. In computer programming, the AND operation is usually written as && (two ampersands). In Boolean algebra, the AND operation of two inputs A and B can be written as AB. Below is the truth table for an AND operation, and the circuit diagram of an AND logic gate. AND A B AB 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 OR The OR logic operation returns true if either of its inputs are true. If all inputs are false, the output is also false. In computer programming, the OR operation is usually written as || (two vertical bars). In Boolean algebra, the OR value of two inputs A and B can be written as A+B. Note Do not mistake the OR operation for arithmetic addition, even though they both use the '+' symbol. They are distinct operations. Below is the truth table for an OR operation, and the circuit diagram of an OR logic gate. OR A B A+B 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 NOT The NOT logic operation returns true if its input is false, and false if its input is true. In computer programming, the NOT operation is usually written as ! (an exclamation mark). In Boolean algebra, the NOT value of an input A can be written as A̅ (A with an overscore). Below is the truth table for a NOT operation, and the circuit diagram of a NOT logic gate. NOT A A̅ 0 1 1 0 NAND The NAND logic operation (which stands for 'NOT AND') returns true if either of its inputs are false, and false if either of its inputs are true. Tip NAND Flash is a type of flash memory based on NAND logic gates. In Boolean algebra, the NAND value of two inputs A and B can be written as (AB with an overscore). NAND has the distinction of being one of two 'universal' logic gates because any other logic operation can be created using only NAND gates. (The other universal logic gate is NOR.) Below is the truth table for a NAND operation, and the circuit diagram of a NAND logic gate. NAND A B ___ AB 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 NOR The NOR logic operation (which stands for 'NOT OR') returns true if either of its inputs are false, and false if either of its inputs are true. Tip NOR Flash is a type of flash memory based on NOR logic gates. In Boolean algebra, the NOR value of two inputs A and B can be written as (A+B with an overscore). NOR has the distinction of being one of two 'universal' logic gates, because any other logic operation can be created using only NOR gates. (The other universal logic gate is NAND.) Below is the truth table for a NOR operation, and the circuit diagram of a NOR logic gate.

Usually, a logo represents a company, organization, product, or service, and is equivalent to a trademark. The image to the right is the logo of Computer Hope. It is composed of shapes that represent the letters 'C' and 'H' in the words 'Computer Hope.' 2. Alternatively referred to as turtle graphics, Logo is pronounced as Low-go and is a high-level programming language known for its graphics capabilities, created by Seymour Papert in 1967. Logo is often used for young school children as a basic method of programming instructions into a computer to create a graphic.

The table may be manually populated when the program is written, or the program may populate the table with values as it calculates them. When the values are needed later, the program can look them up, saving CPU resources. Programming terms Loony bin The loony bin is slang used to describe someone who spends too much time in the cgi-bin directory. The idea behind the sarcastic term is that anyone who spends enough time in the /cgi-bin/ directory is going to become crazy. CGI, Programming terms Loop A loop describes the process of a software program or script repeats the same instructions or processes the same information over and over until receiving the order to stop. If not handled properly, a loop can cause the computer to become slower as it becomes overwhelmed with having to repeat the same steps over and over causing it to get stuck in an endless loop. Batch file loop Below is a basic example of a loop in a batch file. :BEGIN Echo Here is an endless loop! GOTO BEGIN Other types of loops Below are some examples of common types of loops in many programming languages. Control statement, Endless loop, Goto, Iteration, Loop device, Programming terms, Repeat counter, STP Loophole When referring to computing, a loophole is an error or opening in computer code that can allow a program to be manipulated or exploited. This term generally comes up when referencing computer or network security. Exploit, Network, Programming terms Loosely typed language A loosely typed language is a programming language that does not require a variable to be defined. For example, Perl is a loosely typed language, you can declare a variable, but it doesn't require you to classify the type of variable. In the example below, the first line declares the $test variable that can be used as an integer or string. my $test; $test = 1; #Test variable is now integer. $test = 'hello'; #Test variable is now a string. The opposite of a loosely typed languages is a strongly typed language, such as C. Perl, Programming terms Low-level language A low-level language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction of programming concepts and is very close to writing actual machine instructions. Two good examples of low-level languages are assembly and machine code. Uses and other information Low-level languages are useful because written in them can be crafted to run very fast and with a very minimal memory footprint. However, they are considered harder to utilize because they require a deeper knowledge of machine language. Is C or C++ a low-level language? The C and C++ programming languages are considered a 'lower-level' or 'middle-level' languages. They provide a minimal amount of abstraction at the smallest possible cost to performance and efficiency. These abstractions, such as classes, lambda functions, and macros, allow programmers to use complex functionality without writing overly complex code that would be required with machine code. For this reason, C and C++ are considered lower-level languages where abstractions is necessary to keep code highly readable and maintainable, but where maximum performance is paramount.

It was written out of necessity, due to trade barriers that existed at the time making it financially impossible for them to buy custom software from other countries. Today, Lua is used all over the world for many applications, especially computer games. Features of Lua Lua's design is inspired by the SOL (Simple Object Language), which the engineers liked because of its way of incorporating data description into its syntax. The word 'sol' means 'sun' in Portuguese, so the developers named their new language 'lua,' which means 'moon.' The language is multi-paradigm, offering flexible semantic tools for programming in many different styles. It is highly extensible, allowing the language itself to be heavily modified for custom uses. 'Hello, World!' in Lua print('Hello World!') Note When a Lua program is saved, it uses the .lua file extension. Related pages Programming language history. Language, Programming terms Machine language Sometimes referred to as machine code or object code, machine language is a collection of binary digits or bits that the computer reads and interprets. Machine language is the only language a computer is capable of understanding. The exact machine language for a program or action can differ by operating system on the computer. The specific operating system will dictate how a compiler writes a program or action into machine language. Computer programs are written in one or more programming languages, like C++, Java, or Visual Basic. A computer cannot directly understand the programming languages used to create computer programs, so the program code must be compiled. Once a program's code is compiled, the computer can understand it because the program's code is turned into machine language. Machine language example Below is an example of machine language (binary) for the text 'Hello World'. 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100 Below is another example of machine language (non-binary), which will print the letter 'A' 1000 times to the computer screen. 169 1 160 0 153 0 128 153 0 129 153 130 153 0 131 200 208 241 96 Assembly language, Binary, Compilation, High-level language, Low-level language, Machine-readable, Object file, Programming terms, Pseudolanguage, Special purpose language Magic quotes Magic quotes is a feature found in PHP that when enabled automatically escapes any quotes. For example, if you had a variable that contained lot's of 'quotes' it'd be turned into lot 's of  'quotes '. If this feature is enabled and you want to disable it or remove any escape slashes, use the stripslashes command. For example, $example = stripslashes($example) would strip all slashes from the variable named $example. Escape, Programming terms, Quote Map A map may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to programming, or layout of a software program or hardware device, a map refers to the documentation that describes its overall structure. 2. When referring to networks, a map or mapped drive refers to a link to another computer, share, or printer. 3. When referring to HTML, the <map> tag is used with the area element to designate an image map on a web page. 4. In general, a map is a term used to describe instructions that are used to locate a destination in the world. Below is a listing of some popular places on the Internet that help you create driving maps to a destination of your choice. Google Maps - https://maps.google.com/ OpenStreetMap - https://www.openstreetmap.org/ Bing Maps - https://www.bing.com/maps/ Map Quest - https://www.mapquest.com/ Google Earth is also a fantastic, free software program that contains maps, satellite images, places of interest, and much more. Tip Google Maps also has a great feature known as streets view. This feature allows you to drive down many of the streets in the United States and see pictures of the houses, building, and other objects. HTML, MAPS, Network terms, Programming terms, Satellite, Site map Markup language A computer language that consists of easily understood keywords, names, or tags that help format the overall view of a page and the data it contains. Some examples of a markup language are BBC, HTML, SGML, and XML. Markup language example Below is an example segment of HTML code that creates bold text on a web page. Example of <b>bold</b> in HTML. As can be seen in the example above, the <b> tag is one of many HTML tags that can be used in HTML to change the look of the page. Below is an example of the output. Example of bold in HTML. Markup language vs. programming language A markup language is not a programming language. It's a series of special markings, interspersed with plain text, which if removed or ignored, leave the plain text as a complete whole. Or, those markings can be interpreted in a predefined manner (make this text bold, make this text an ordered list) that enhances its presentation to the reader. In contrast, plain text may be (and often is) part of a computer program; however, its representation will vary according to the programming language, and the programmer's style of writing. Importantly, if all non-plain-text components of a computer program are removed, the remaining plain text is not guaranteed to be complete, or correctly ordered. For example, the HTML that makes up this web page is a good example of markup. The HTML tags indicate how the textual components of the content are displayed in your web browser. But, if the HTML (and CSS and JavaScript) were removed, the majority of the text would remain, and be legible by a human. However, like all markup languages, HTML is limited in creating interactive, dynamic, or computational behaviors. To create a web page that can perform more sophisticated functions, (e.g., search), a programming language (such as JavaScript, Perl, or PHP) is necessary. BBC, HTML, Markdown, Markup, Programming terms, SGML, SMIL, Web design terms Math Most computer programming languages provide a Math library which facilitates common or complicated mathematical operations. In object-oriented programming, it may take the form of an object with properties and methods to perform those functions. For instance, the JavaScript Math object provides constant values such as E (Euler's number), LN2, LN10, LOG2E, LOG10E, PI, SQRT1_2, and SQRT2. It also includes methods which allow the programmer to make mathematical calculations like square roots, rounding, trigonometry functions, and more. In JavaScript, the Math object can be used directly to access on of its properties or methods, such as in the JavaScript code in the example below. var x = 2 * Math.PI * 32; var y = Math.sqrt(4); The example shows the use of the PI property and a call to the sqrt() method. Programming terms MATLAB Short for matrix laboratory, MATLAB is a computing and visualization software package, as well as a fourth generation programming language, published by MathWorks. It performs matrix manipulations, function plotting, algorithm implementation, and many high-level mathematical operations. Its companion package, Simulink, is used for graphical multi-domain simulation. MATLAB was originally written in the late 1970s by Cleve Moler, the chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico. Moler wanted to give his students a way to use linear algebra and matrix computation packages without having to learn FORTRAN. Today, it is utilized mainly by engineers and students of linear algebra, with over a million users worldwide. Computer abbreviations, Computer Science, Domain-specific language, Octave, Programming, Programming terms, R programming language, Simulation Mbean Short for Managed Beans, MBeans are objects in Java. Mbean gives the programmer access to management tools for system objects, devices, and application monitoring and management, and allow other tasks to be executed. Types of MBeans There are numerous types of MBean, the two basic types are standard and dynamic, while others build on these. Standard MBeans set up a management interface using methods. Dynamic MBeans set up the management interface at runtime and use javax.management.DynamicMBean . . A MXBean (also called Platform MBean) is a special MBean that uses only a set of predefined data types, allowing applications to more easily work cross-platform. A MLet (short for Management applet) is a MBean that loads and registers MBeans from an XML description file. Open MBeans are dynamic MBeans that make use basic data types to be more portable. Model MBeans are dynamic MBeans that can be set up at runtime. Computer abbreviations, Java, Programming terms Memoization Memoization is a technique used in computer programming wherein a program 'remembers' the result of a computationally expensive function call by storing it in a cache. If the function is called later using the same inputs, the result is loaded from the cache rather than being recomputed, saving CPU resources. In some cases, memoization may give a benefit other than speed. One example is mutual recursion, in which two mathematical objects are defined in terms of one another. Memoization can allow mutual recursion operations to be computed easier, but not necessarily more quickly. In some logical programming languages, memoization may be referred to as tabling because it is used as a technique to populate a lookup table. Function call, Programming terms Mercurial First released on April 19, 2005, Mercurial is a version control system for software development. It is supported by Microsoft Windows, macOS X, BSD, and Linux. Several popular GUI front ends for Mercurial exist, including TortoiseHg, MacHg, SourceTree, Hgk, Murky, MacMercurial, and hgtui. It is used by many major software developers including Facebook, Mozilla, and the W3C. Programming terms Metacharacter A metacharacter is a character, or a sequence of characters, that has a special meaning in a computing application. It might be used to represent another set of characters, an unprintable character, or a logical operation. For example, in some applications, is interpreted as a newline. (In this case, a backslash is used to escape the n character, indicating that it should be interpreted as a metacharacter.) Metacharacters are frequently used in regular expressions. For instance, the following Perl statement uses a regular expression to delete any newlines from the contents of the variable $data. $data =~ s/ //; This statement says 'assign a new value to $data which substitutes any newline in $data with nothing.' For a list of common metacharacters, and examples of how to use them, please see our regular expressions quick reference. Character, Escape, Meta-data, Programming terms, Wildcard Metaclass In object-oriented computer programming, a metaclass is one whose instances are also classes. For instance, in Python, the built-in class type is a metaclass: instances of class type are themselves a class of objects. The use of metaclasses is most prevalent in object-oriented languages. In these languages, classes are 'first-class' objects, meaning they can be used exactly like any other object in the language. They can be named variables. They can be passed as an argument to methods, functions, and procedures. They can be returned as the result of a method, function, or procedure. They can be included as part of a data structure. It is possible, but uncommon, to implement metaclasses in C++ and Java. More commonly, metaclasses can be found in programs written in Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, Perl, Objective-C, and Common Lisp/CLOS. Object-oriented, Programming, Programming terms Metalanguage Term used to describe a programming language that is classified as a markup language, similar to a standard language, utilizing various rules, statements, and expressions. A good example of a metalanguage is XML. Programming terms Method overloading Method overloading is a form of function overloading used in object-oriented programming. Multiple methods share the same name, but take a set of arguments that differ either in type or quantity. Programming terms Method In programming, a method is a function that is a member of a class/object (in technical terms, it is bound to that class/object). The method has access to the variables and properties defined in the class/object and can perform tasks on any instances of the class/object. Below, is an example using JavaScript where an object named GPS is created, and includes a method named send_msg. function GPS(msg)   this.send_msg = function()   window.alert(msg);     var lost = new GPS('You are lost!'); lost.send_msg(); The send_msg method sends a message stored with each instance of the GPS object as a pop-up alert to the user when run. In this case, when the code is run, the user gets a pop-up message that says 'You are lost!'. Class, Object, Programming terms Metro Metro is a programming language, created by Microsoft, originally for use with Windows Phone 7. The language is typography-based, meaning it focuses more on typography versus graphics ('content before chrome'). Microsoft has also used Metro in the Xbox 360 dashboard (updated version) and in Windows 8. Metro was primarily developed to improve usage and performance around common tasks that many users perform. Some aspects of Metro could be seen in the Windows Media Center edition for Windows XP. Microsoft also used some bits of Metro in the new Zune interface in 2006. Overall, Metro has received positive reactions from most users. It was also awarded the People's Choice Design gold award from the Industrial Designers Society of America. GUI, Programming terms Middleware Sometimes referred to as glue, middleware is a term that describes a program, service, or portion of programming code that allows two or more programs to work with each other. Programming terms Mimo MIMO or Mimo may refer to the following: 1. An acronym for multiple-input and multiple-output, MIMO is wireless communication technology that incorporates two or more antennas in a single device. In a MIMO device, one or more input antennas (receivers) and output antennas (transmitters) operate simultaneously on a single channel. Using multiplexing, multipath propagation, and multiple degrees of spatial diversity, MIMO can increase the bandwidth and reduce the latency of network connections. 2. Stylized as m1m0, Mimo is a web application, and a mobile app that teaches users to code in multiple programming languages, including Java, HTML, Python, C++, Kotlin, and others. Basic courses are available for free, but for more advanced lessons, a monthly fee is required. Computer acronyms, Programming language, Programming terms, Web application Module A module may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to computer software, a module is a discrete piece of code which can be independently created and maintained to be used in different systems. For example, a developer may create a module that contains the code required to use a sound card or perform I/O on a certain type of filesystem. The module can then be distributed for and used by any system that needs that functionality, and development of the module can proceed independently. This approach is known as modular design. The Linux kernel is modular in this way. LKMs (Linux kernel modules) can be loaded using programs such as modprobe. 2. When referring to computer hardware, a module is an independent component that can be used as part of a more complex system. For example, a memory module can be connected to a computer's motherboard to operate as part of the complete system. Programming terms Modulo Modulo is a math operation that finds the remainder when one integer is divided by another. In writing, it is frequently abbreviated as mod, or represented by the symbol %. For two integers a and b: a mod b = r Where a is the dividend, b is the divisor (or modulus), and r is the remainder. Examples 11 mod 4 = 3, because 11 divides by 4 (twice), with 3 remaining. 25 mod 5 = 0, because 25 divides by 5 (five times), with 0 remaining. 3 mod 2 = 1, because 3 divides by 2 (once), with 1 remaining. 5 mod 2 = 1, because all odd numbers give a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Modular arithmetic and cryptography Modular arithmetic is the field of mathematics which concerns these types of operations, in which values 'wrap around' (reset to zero) when they reach a modulus value. Modular arithmetic is extremely important in the field of cryptography, which encodes information using modulo operations that have a very large modulus. Computer abbreviations, Cryptography, Mod, Programming terms Monte Carlo method Monte Carlo method are algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling. It was named by Stanislaw Ulam while he was working on nuclear weapons projects at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, after the Monte Carlo Casino, where his grandfather often gambled. Monte Carlo methods are frequently used in mathematical or physics problems. They are used to solve problems of optimization, numerical integration, and probability distribution. In physics, Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating fluid dynamics and cellular structures. In economics, Monte Carlo methods can be used to simulate uncertainty and risk in business ventures. A simple example of using a Monte Carlo method would be to draw a unit square and a unit circle inside it, and then scatter coins on the square in a uniformly random manner. By calculating the ratio of coins that fall inside the circle to those that fall outside of it (assuming all coins fell in the unit square), one could approximate the area of the circle. The more coins thrown, the closer the approximation would come to the actual area, which for the unit circle is pi.

Related pages The MSDN website is https://msdn.microsoft.com. Computer acronyms, Programming terms MSVC MSVC stands for Microsoft Visual C++, an IDE (integrated development environment) for the C and C++ programming languages. It is a tool for writing and debugging C, C++, and C# code, most notably code written for Microsoft Windows, the .NET Framework or DirectX. MSVC is available in the Express Edition or as part of the Microsoft Visual Studio. The latest version (as of 2012) includes tools for programming in JavaScript and F# as well. Computer abbreviations, JavaScript, Programming terms Multi-pass compiler Software compiler that may pass through source code multiple times. Multi-pass compilers are slower, but much more efficient when compiling. Compile, One-pass compiler, Programming terms MUMPS MUMPS, also known as M, is a programming language first developed in 1966 by Neil Pappalardo at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. It has many unique features, including a built-in database, an absence of distinct data types, and a syntax which contains no reserved words. MUMPS programs exist in separated 'memory partitions' and can reference both RAM and disk storage using variables. This feature permitted unusually fast data access times regardless of storage medium. Although nearly 50 years old, MUMPS is still widely used, particularly by financial and medical institutions. 'Hello, World!' written in MUMPS hello() write 'Hello, World!',! quit Related pages Programming language history. Database, Hello World, Language, Programming terms Mutex Mutex, which is short for mutual exclusion object, is a computer programming term. It describes an object that permits more than one thread to access the same shared resources, but never at the same time. A shared resource may be something like data residing in memory or an input/output device, such as a disk controller. Enforcing mutual exclusion is an important part of preventing race conditions.

ASP.NET, C#, CLR, F#, IDE, Net, Programming terms, Silverlight, VB NaN Short for not a number, in mathematics and computer programming NaN is an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. For example, 0/0 or the square root of a negative number would return a NaN result. In programming a NaN can also occur if your variables or another input contains any character that is not a number or period. For example, trying to do a calculation on a variable with letters or commas causes a NaN error. NaN example output Depending on the operating system, programming language, or program NaN can also appear as any of the examples below.

High-level language, Native language, Programming terms Native language Sometimes referred to as the host language, the native language is the language understood by the computer. For example, binary is the language understood by the computer. In programming, native code is code that is written to run on a specific processor. To run the code on a different processor, an emulator must be used to trick the program into thinking it has a different processor. If an emulator is used, the code almost always runs more slowly than it would in its native environment. Binary, Native compiler, Programming terms Natural language Natural language is the idea of creating a programming language that uses the grammar, vocabulary, and syntax of the human language. Natural language processing, Programming terms NBSP Alternatively referred to as a fixed space or hard space, NBSP (non-breaking space) is used in programming, and word processing to create a space in a line that cannot be broken by word wrap. With HTML, allows you to create multiple spaces that are visible on a web page and not only in the source code. Creating a fixed space in a word processor and other programs To create a fixed or hard space in a word processor such as Microsoft Office or OpenOffice, use one of the keyboard shortcuts below. Windows users: Ctrl+Alt+Space, Ctrl+Space or hold down Alt and press 0160 or 255 on the num pad. Apple users: Option+Space. Microsoft Word: Ctrl+Shift+Space. WordPerfect and OpenOffice: Ctrl+Space. OpenOffice: Ctrl+Space (before 3.0) or Ctrl+Shift+Space (after 3.0). Vim: Ctrl+K, Space, Space or Ctrl+K Shift+N Shift+S. Creating an NBSP in HTML An example of how a user may insert an NBSP in HTML would be by adding the below extended HTML tag. or With the examples above, using this tag would allow you to create multiple spaces in a row, something that cannot be done by only pressing the spacebar. To create multiple spaces, add one of the above non-breaking space tags for each time you want an extra space. For example, if you wanted ten extra spaces in front of text you could add ten of these tags. Tip If you need to indent or add extra spacing to a paragraph, sentence, or another portion of your web page, we suggest using CSS instead of multiple non-breaking spaces. You can also use the <pre> tag. Null character, Programming terms, Spacebar NDA Short for non-disclosure agreement, NDA is an agreement a tester or developer makes to a company, indicating they will not disclose any of the company's intellectual property or secrets. For example, if you are beta testing a game, you usually agree to a NDA, which means you cannot post anything about the game while it's being tested. Business terms, Computer abbreviations, Programming terms Ne Short for not equal, ne or != is an operator used in programming languages and in command line commands. For example, in programming languages such as Perl, you could type something similar to the example below. if ($variable1 ne $variable2)   print 'They are not the same';   In the example above, if the value stored in $variable1 is not equal to $variable2, the program would print They are not the same. Computer acronyms, Eq, Equal, Programming terms Nested loops join Nested loops join, also known as a nested loop join, is a computer programming algorithm that joins two sets of data using nested loops, frequently used in database management. Example of nested loop join written in pseudocode for each element in data set 1   for each element in data set 2   if element from 1 and element from 2 meet the conditions for joining, then   join element from 1 and element from 1 into data set 3       Algorithm, Loop, Programming terms, Pseudocode Nest A nest may refer to any of the following: 1. Nesting is a term used to describe the placement of one or more objects within another object. For example, when referring to a computer, nesting may refer to inserting a graphic image into a word processor. 2. With computer programming, a nested function is a function contained inside of another function in the source code of a program. An example of this in JavaScript is shown below. function outerFunction()   function innerFunction()   // code     Often, this type of nesting is used to limit the scope of the inner function. Note The inner function can only be called by the function containing it or another function in the containing function. In the example above, outerFunction() could call innerFunction(), but innerFunction() could not be called from the global scope or from any function outside of outerFunction(). Nesting isolates the code it contains from code scoped outside the nested section. With HTML, XML, and other markup languages nesting is the data between the opening and closing tags. For example, with the XML code shown below 'computersoftware' is the root tag which contains all other XML information. The 'product' tag nests all of the product information, and 'name,' 'description,' 'developer,' and 'cost' all nest information relating to each tag. <computersoftware> <product> <name>Windows 8</name> <description>Microsoft Windows 8 operating system - Full version.</description> <developer>Microsoft</developer> <cost>132.78</cost> </product> </computersoftware> 3. The term Nest may also refer to the Nest Learning Thermostat. Object, Programming terms Newline A newline is a character used to represent the end of a line of text and the beginning of a new line. In programming languages, such as C, Java, and Perl, the newline character is represented as a ' ' escape sequence. Below are examples of how the newline could be used in Perl. #!/usr/bin/perl # Print 'Hello World!' and start a new line with print 'Hello World! '; #Locate and replace any newlines in the mydata variable #and replace those newlines with a ** as the separator. $mydata =~ s/  */g; In the first section of the example code above, Perl would first print 'Hello World!' and move to the next line. In the second section of the example code, the $mydata variable would have all new lines stripped and replaced with '**'. Using this type of regular expression is helpful with parsing text with newlines or place data with newlines in a single line of text. Note A newline is not the same as a carriage return. CR, LF, Line, Line break, Meta-character, Programming terms, White space Nim Nim may refer to any of the following: 1. Originally named Nimrod, Nim is a computer programming language first introduced in 2008 that enforces a high level of data type safety. Nimrod is used in software development projects that require strict limits on how a system's memory is used. Here is an example of a 'Hello, World!' program written in Nim. echo 'Hello World!'

Shorthand for No Internal Message, NIM is sometimes used at the end of an e-mail subject line to indicate there is nothing more to the message than that said on the subject. NIM helps the reader know they don't have to open the message. Since most e-mail programs and services now have a preview of the message body, NIM is rarely used today. E-mail terms, Nimrod, Programming terms Node.js Node.js, also referred to as node, is a runtime environment for server-side applications, first released in 2009. It is an open source software architecture that is event-driven: it detects and reacts to things that happen, as they happen. Node provides an input/output API that is non-blocking, meaning node programs can make I/O requests and continue without waiting for the response. This approach has important uses in web applications, where the user should be able to use your site, page, or application even while I/O is occurring in the background. This type of application is called asynchronous because individual operations can proceed independently of the main program flow. Node programs are written in JavaScript. Its JavaScript engine is V8, the open source engine which was developed at Google for its Chrome web browser. Here is a simple web server, written for node.js, which listens on port 8080 for HTTP requests, and responds with 'Hello, World!': var http = require('http'); http.createServer(function (request, response)   response.writeHead(200,  'Content-Type': 'text/plain' ); response.end('Hello, World! ');  ).listen(8080); Node was created by web developer Ryan Dahl, who was frustrated by the blocking nature of most web server software. Node is used to power websites for Dow Jones, New York Times, PayPal, eBay, and Uber, among other companies. Applications, Asynchronous, Environment, Programming terms, Server, Web application NodeList In the DOM (Document Object Model) in browsers, NodeList is an object that consists of a list of all nodes in a document or of all the nodes within a particular selected set of nodes. A NodeList can be selected using a programming language such as JavaScript. For example, a NodeList can be selected using the getElementsByTagName() method of the document object in JavaScript. The example below obtains a collection of all the div nodes in the document. var div_nodes = document.getElementsByTagName('div'); If there are two div elements in the document, the NodeList (the value of the div_nodes variable here) will contain two nodes. If there are three elements, the NodeList will contain three elements, etc. Programming terms Noncontiguous data structure A noncontiguous data structure is a method of storing data in sectors of memory that are not adjoining. Contiguous data structure, Memory terms, Programming terms Nonexecutable statement Programming command that is not run or executed when being read by the computer. For example, a commonly used nonexecutable statement is REM (remark) used in batch files and other Microsoft Windows and DOS programs. The following is a listing of other text used to remark, comment, or cause the line to be skipped. # The pound symbol is a used to comment a line in programming languages such as Perl. This symbol is only required once at the beginning of what you want ignored. ; The semicolon is used to remark a line in an INI file and in AutoHotkey. This symbol is only required once at the beginning of the line. Note that it must be at the beginning of the line in an INI file. ! The exclamation mark is used in scripting programs to comment a line. This symbol is commonly required at the beginning of the line.   */ Used to add a comment to a line in the C, PHP and other programming languages. The comment must begin with ' ' and end with '*/'. The following is an example of how this may look.   Computer Hope comment */ // Two forward slashes at the beginning of a line is used to add a comment to JavaScript. The following is an example of how this may look. //JavaScript comment example <!-- --> Used in HTML and some other scripting languages. Begin the comment with '<!--' and end it with '-->' The following is an example of how this may look in the HTML code. <!-- Computer Hope comment --> ' In Microsoft QBasic starting a line with single quote is a way of creating a nonexecutable line. Example of Nonexecutable statements The following is a basic example of a Perl script and an example of how nonexecutable statements (comments) may appear in the code. #Example of nonexecutable statements, this line is ignored. use strict; #Use strict to prevent errors. my $name = 'Nathan'; #Set the name variable to Nathan print 'Hello $name how are you? '; #Print greeting In the above Perl example a comment in Perl can start either at the beginning of a line to help describe a section of code and can be used at the end of a line to describe a line.

Tip This term is pronounced as no op. Examples of an NOP in different programing languages In C a semicolon ( ; ) by itself or an empty block (    ) is an NOP. With jQuery the 'jQuery.noop()' function creates an NOP. In Perl the ellipsis statement ( … ) can be used in as an NOP. However, if Perl tries executing the code it gives an Unimplemented exception . . In Python the 'pass' statement can be used as an NOP. With Visual Basic a semicolon ( ; ) is an NOP. Computer abbreviations, Programming terms Null Null defines a lack of value.

In databases and spreadsheets, a null character can also be used as padding. An example of a null character is when a software developer creates a null value by declaring a variable without specifying a value or setting it equal to nothing. Nbsp, Non-printing character, Null, Programming terms Null pointer When referring to computer memory, a null pointer is a command used to direct software or the operating system to an empty location in the computer memory. Commonly, the null pointer is used to denote the end of a memory search or processing event. In computer programming, a null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any object or function. A nil pointer is a false value. For example, 1 > 2 is a nil statement. In the programming language C, NULL is an available command that can be used, where nil is an available command used in the Pascal programming language. Memory terms, NULL, Programming terms Generation languages A generation language may refer to any of the following: 1. The first generation languages, or 1GL, are low-level languages that are machine language. 2. The second-generation languages, or 2GL, are also low-level assembly languages. They are sometimes used in kernels and hardware drives, but more commonly used for video editing and video games. 3. The third-generation languages, or 3GL, are high-level languages, such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Visual Basic. 4. The fourth-generation languages, or 4GL, are languages that consist of statements similar to statements in a human language. Fourth generation languages are commonly used in database programming and scripts examples include Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and SQL. 5. The fifth-generation languages, or 5GL, are programming languages that contain visual tools to help develop a program. Examples of fifth generation languages include Mercury, OPS5, and Prolog. Assembly, Generation, High-level languages, Low-level language, Machine language, Programming language, Programming terms %1,  1, and $1 When used in a command line, script, or batch file, a %1 is used to represent a variable or matched string. For example, in a Microsoft batch file, %1 can be used to print what is entered after the batch file name. In the example below of a batch file using the %1, the batch file will print Hello xxxx it's nice to meet you, where xxxx is whatever you enter after the name of the batch file. So, if this batch file was named example.bat and you typed example Nathan, the batch file would return Hello Nathan it's nice to meet you. @echo off if %1== goto error echo Hello %1 it's nice to meet you goto end :error echo type your name after batch file. :end Related pages Batch file help and additional information. In other programming languages and script languages, the %1 may be substituted for  1 or $1. For example, in Perl, these could be used in a regular expression to print out the matched text or be used as a new variable. In the example below, if the $text variable contains any text, it will print Hello xxxx, where xxxx is what is matched. So, if $text = Joe Smith, the script would return Hello Joe. if ($text =~ s/^([a-z +)/i)   print Hello $1 ;   Each of these matched strings or variables can also be extended upon by increasing the value. For example, the next matched string or variable found could be entered in as %2,  2, or $2. In the above batch file example, you could add a %2 to also print the last name as shown in the example below. If no last name was entered, the %2 would print nothing. echo Hello %1 %2 it's nice to meet you In the case of the above Perl example, adding $2 would print the second matched string in the parentheses, as shown below. if ($text =~ s/^([a-z +) ([a-z +)/i)   print Hello $1 $2 ;   You can also add additional matched strings or variables by using 3, 4, 5, etc. (E.g., %3, %4 or $3, $4.) $, Percent, Programming terms, Variable Obfuscation Obfuscation is code or instructions that are purposely complicated to help conceal what the code performs. A programmer may do this to help prevent the program from being modified, stolen, or prevent a program from reading the code and understanding its true, malicious, intentions. For example, obfuscation is used with URLs to conceal the real address a user is directed to when clicking on a link from an e-mail message or web page. In some instances, obfuscated code is used in contests as brain teasers. Below is an example of an obfuscated batch file that prints 'GOD BLESS YOU!' that was taken from the Computer Hope forum. @echo off setlocal %1 %0 :: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z set A=%5&set B=%6&set C=%8&set D=%3 for %%? in (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) do shift set A=%C%%7%A%&set C=%D%%4%B%&set D=%7 for %%? in (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) do shift echo %A% %C%%2%2 %8%D%%4! The above code is difficult to understand without taking the time to break down the code and is a lot more difficult than 'echo GOD BLESS YOU.' Related pages Computer security questions and answers. IOCCC, KISS, Programming terms, Security terms, Spaghetti Code Objective-C Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language first developed in the mid-1980s by engineers Brad Cox and Tom Love. It is based on the C programming language and uses a system of message passing derived from the programming language Smalltalk. Objective-C was licensed by NeXT in 1988 and is the programming language used in the majority of Apple software today. What is different about Objective-C? In Objective-C, object-oriented programming is based on passing messages between object instances. Unlike other OOP languages where you call the method of an instance to invoke its behavior, in Objective-C you send it a message. The two types of programming are more or less equivalent, but there are differences. For example, when an object in Objective-C is sent a message, it can choose to ignore it or forward it on to another object, rather than return a value. Here is an example 'Hello, World!' program written in Objective-C: #import <stdio.h> #import <foundation foundation.h=''> int main(void)   NSLog(@'Hello, world! '); return 0;   Related pages Programming language history.

The object modules contain a specific function such as enabling a device on a computer. Programming terms OCaml OCaml, also known as Objective Caml (Object-oriented Categorical Abstract Machine Language), is an object-oriented version of the Caml programming language. Since its introduction in 1996, Ocaml has become the main implementation of Caml. It utilizes an interactive interpreter, but includes a compiler for creating binary executables. It has influenced other widely-used programming languages, including F# and Scala. Note OCaml should not be confused with the camel books by O'Reilly for the Perl programming language.

Tip The JavaScript OnMouseOver effect can also be achieved using CSS without the visitor needing to have JavaScript enabled on their browser. OnMouseOver example The example below shows you how you could create simple buttons that have an onmouseover effect. When placing your mouse over one of the buttons below, it will change to a darker color indicating that it can be clicked to go to the specified page. OnMouseOver example instructions Below is an overview of how the above example was created. In the red sections below are the image files. For example, the om1.gif and om11.gif are the two files used for the on and off positions. The file om1.gif is displayed when the mouse is not over the image, so in the above example would be the light gray. When hovering over the image, it would change to om11.gif a darker gray. You can follow this same format when creating your images or if so desired you can change the naming format. The blue section is the variable to store the on and off image locations for each button. For example, onef is the off position (f for off) and oneo is the mouse on position image. In our above example, there are five buttons that have a set of two images, so a total of 10 images. In the Orange sections are the image links. These links could point to any page you want the button to forward the visitor to on your website. <script> <!-- if (document.images)   var onef = new Image(); onef .src =' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om1.gif '; var oneo = new Image(); oneo .src = ' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om11.gif '; var twof = new Image(); twof .src = ' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om2.gif '; var twoo = new Image(); twoo .src = ' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om22.gif '; var threef = new Image(); threef .src = ' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om3.gif '; var threeo = new Image(); threeo .src = ' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/ om33.gif '; var fourf = new Image(); fourf .src = ' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/ om4.gif '; var fouro = new Image(); fouro .src = ' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/ om44.gif '; var fivef = new Image(); fivef .src = ' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/ om5.gif '; var fiveo = new Image(); fiveo .src = ' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/ om55.gif ';   function act(imgName)   if (document.images) document[imgName .src = eval(imgName + ' o.src ');   function inact(imgName)   if (document.images) document[imgName .src = eval(imgName + ' f.src ');   // --> </script> <p> < a href='https://www.computerhope.com/learnhtm.htm' onMouseOver='act(' one ')' onMouseOut='inact(' one ')'> <img src=' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om1.gif ' name=' one ' alt='HTML'></a><br> < a href=' https://www.computerhope.com/ oh.htm' onMouseOver='act(' two ')' onMouseOut='inact(' two ')'> <img src=' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om2.gif ' name=' two ' alt='Online help'></a><br> < a href='https://www.computerhope.com/vlist.htm' onMouseOver='act(' three ')' onMouseOut='inact(' three ')'> <img src=' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om3.gif ' name=' three ' alt='Virus information'></a><br> < a href='https://www.computerhope.com/jargon.htm' onMouseOver='act(' four ')' onMouseOut='inact(' four ')'> <img src=' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om4.gif ' name=' four ' alt='Computer jargon'></a><br> < a href='https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/internet.htm' onMouseOver='act(' five ')' onMouseOut='inact(' five ')'> <img src=' https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/om5.gif ' name=' five ' alt='Internet Info'></a> </p> Event, JavaScript, Programming terms OOP Coined by Alan Kay, object-oriented programming, also known as OOP or o-o programming, is a programming language paradigm. In an object-oriented program, the code can be structured as reusable components, some of which may share properties or behaviors. Object-oriented programming can improve the developer's ability to quickly prototype software, extend existing functionality, refactor the code, and maintain it as it's developed. Object-oriented programming concepts When programming in an object-oriented programming language, you should keep the following four key concepts in mind. Encapsulation - The grouping of related functions and data (variables) together into an object to help reduce complexity and allow parts of the code to be reused. - The grouping of related functions and data (variables) together into an object to help reduce complexity and allow parts of the code to be reused. Abstraction - Show only the essentials to reduce the abstract of change. - Show only the essentials to reduce the abstract of change. Inheritance - Eliminate redundant code by inheriting functions and data from other classes. - Eliminate redundant code by inheriting functions and data from other classes. Polymorphism - Change how an object function depending on the data or class. What is an OOPL? An OOPL (object-oriented programming language) is a programming language that is based on the object-oriented programming model explained above. Examples of object-oriented programming languages are C++, C#, Java, Python, Simula, and Smalltalk. General OOP example Let's say you are writing a video game in which the players control and race vehicles. If you are using an object-oriented programming language, you can define a class of objects named 'vehicle.' This class can contain definitions of the qualities and behaviors shared by all vehicles. For example, all vehicles accelerate and decelerate, and consume fuel. Within this class definition, you can define methods (similar to functions) called 'accelerate' and 'decelerate,' and a property (a type of variable) called 'fuel,' whose value you can get or set. Then, you could define subclasses, also called derived classes or child classes, that inherit methods and properties from the 'vehicle' class. For example, you could define a subclass called 'motorcycle' that has two wheels, and a subclass called 'car' that has four wheels. Their shared qualities (acceleration, deceleration, and fuel consumption) are already defined in 'vehicle,' so you don't need to write those again. Then, you could instantiate these subclasses to define individual playable vehicles. Each instance of the subclass would inherit methods and properties from all its parent classes, and have properties and methods of its own. For example, its unique properties might include paint color ('red,' 'blue,' etc.), and price (if the player wants to purchase it with in-game currency). Later, when you want to change the code that is specific to a motorcycle, you don't need to change the parent 'vehicle' class. The 'vehicle' code has already been tested, and works fine, so modifying your program requires less work. Additionally, because fewer lines of code are being modified, there is a reduced chance that a bug will be introduced somewhere in the new code. If a bug does appear, you don't need to wonder if it's in the 'vehicle' class code, because that class was not modified. Development and maintenance of the software may therefore be more efficient, saving time and effort. Class, Computer acronyms, Object, Object module, Object-oriented, Polymorphism, Programming terms Operation code Sometimes referred to as opcode, operation code is code that instructs the computer on what task it should perform. Programming terms OpenGL polygon In computer graphics programming, an OpenGL polygon is a polygonal (multi-sided) shape drawn using the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL). Example of an OpenGL polygon In OpenGL, a polygon is created by specifying a series of vertices. For example, using OpenGL and C++, the following code draws a triangle: glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES); // Drawing Using Triangles glVertex3f( 0.0f, 0.5f, 0.0f); // Top glVertex3f( 0.5f,-0.5f, 0.0f); // Bottom Right glVertex3f(-0.5f,-0.5f, 0.0f); // Bottom Left glEnd(); // Finished Drawing The Triangle Related pages OpenGL official website OpenGL, Programming terms Operand In computer programming, an operand is a term used to describe any object that is capable of being manipulated. For example, in '1 + 2' the '1' and '2' are the operands and the plus symbol is the operator. Related pages How do I create a computer program? Expression, Operator, Programming terms Operator associatively The order that operators execute, commonly executing left to right. For example, if you had 5-4+3, the operator associatively would execute 5-4 before adding 3. Operator, Programming terms Operator An operator may refer to any of the following: 1. In computer programming and at the command line, an operator is an object that is capable of manipulating a value or operator. For example, in '1 + 2', the '1' and '2' are the operands and the plus symbol is the operator. Below is a listing of common operators found in programming languages with explanations and examples. Tip Booleans are also considered operators where AND, OR, and NOT can also be used in most programming languages. 2. An op is a person who controls an IRC channel. See the op page for further information about this term. Arithmetic operator, Conditional expression, Decrement, Exclamation mark, Increment, Logic operator, Op, Operand, Operator associatively, Operator precedence, Order of operations, Programming terms, Syntactic sugar, Ternary operator Operator precedence An operator precedence is the order that an operator is executed. For example, many times a multiplication operator will execute before the addition operator. See our order of operations definition for a full description. Operator, Programming terms OR operator The OR operator is a Boolean operator that executes an operation or task if one or more values or operands are met. For example, 1 + 1 = 3 or 1 + 1 = 2 is true because 1 + 1 does equal 2 even though 1 + 1 does not equal 3. For languages or services that do not accept the word 'or' as an operator it is often replaced with the pipe symbol, as shown in the Perl code below. use strict; if ((1 + 1 == 3) || (1 + 1 == 2))   print 'True ';   else   print 'False ';   In the example above, the double pipe ( || ) is the OR operator. Since one of the problems is true, running this script would return 'True.'. Operator, Programming terms Overflow error There are two types of overflow errors; one has to do with the internal memory stack of the program, and the other has to do with the amount of memory used to store data. Each program has a section of memory allocated for a stack. The stack is used to store internal data for the program and is very fast and keep track of return addressing. In other words, a program may jump to an area that reads some data from the hard drive, then it returns from that routine to continue processing the data. The stack keeps track of the originating address, and the program uses that for the return. Kind of like leaving breadcrumbs to find your way back. That being said, the stack has a limited amount of storage space. Between using it for storing return addresses, and as well as memory usage for storing variables, it can run out and all the little bits of data overflow and cause programs to crash. The stack overflow problem is not as prevalent on the newer operating systems, however, because of the small footprint on mobile devices it can become challenging. If your operating system on your mobile device is giving you a stack overflow error, you may have too many apps running. You may have a virus using stack space. You could even have hardware damage that could cause a stack overflow error message. Check your app usage and virus protection and run a memory diagnostic app on your mobile device to see if this helps clear up your error. An overflow error that is created by storage assignment is referenced as a data type overflow. What this means is that a certain data type used for storing a piece of data was not large enough to hold the data. As an example, if you have a box that is supposed to hold ten cans of soup, but you have twelve cans to put in it then you have an overflow of two cans of soup. By the same token certain data types can only store numbers of a certain size. If a data type is a single byte, and the data to be stored is greater than 256 then there is an overflow error generated and the program crashes because it has corrupted data. This type of error usually only happens with older machines trying to run modern operating systems since the capacity of the operating system over shadows the capacity of the hardware. In other words, you may get overflow errors when an application requests 64 bits of storage when the program can only offer 32. This type of overflow error is usually on the programmers shoulders, and there is very little an end user can do to facilitate an easy remedy besides checking for a software update or patch. Error, Programming terms, Underflow Overload Overload may refer to any of the following: 1. In general, overload is a term used to describe when a device or service exceeds its recommended limits. For example, a popular network may become overloaded with users or the power supply may become overloaded when a surge occurs. Often when an overload occurs, the device or service performs poorly or not at all. 2. Overloading refers to a set of processes in computer programming by which one special word or symbol may be given multiple meanings: Function overloading is a feature found in several programming languages, notably C++ and Java, that allows several functionally different functions or methods to share the same name. For example, myfunction() and myfunction(object Obj) may be entirely separate functions. The compiler may choose which function to execute based on the arguments passed. Operator overloading, also known as 'ad hoc polymorphism,' is a process in computer programming. An operator (such as + or -) may be 'overloaded' such that it performs a different operation, depending on its operands. For instance, a + b may perform addition if the variables a and b are both numbers. But if the + operator is overloaded to handle matrices, it can automatically perform matrix addition if a and b are matrices. Fault tolerance, Programming terms Package A package may refer to any of the following: 1. With software, a package is a module that can be added to any program to add additional options, features, or functionality. A package can often be added to program by using an 'include' or 'import' type of statement, as in the below Java code. import java.io.FileReader; The FileReader package is used for reading character streams, useful for obtaining user input from a console. 2. With hardware, a package is a single container that contains one or more items that help make up the overall package. For example, a processor package is the overall computer processor, which contains all the necessary parts that allow it to work in your computer. CPU terms, Programming terms Parenthesis A parenthesis is a punctuation mark used to enclose information, similar to a bracket. The open parenthesis, which looks like (, is used to begin parenthetical text. The close parenthesis, ), denotes the end of parenthetical text. The plural of parenthesis is parentheses. Tip Parentheses are also called curved brackets, especially outside of the United States. How to type parentheses To type an open parenthesis on a U.S. keyboard, hold down the Shift key and press 9 at the top of the keyboard. To type a close parenthesis, hold Shift and press 0. To create a tilde on a smartphone or tablet, open the touch keyboard, switch to the numbers (123) or symbols (sym) section, and touch the '(' or ')' symbol. What are parentheses used for? In writing, parentheses can be used to express additional information, an aside, or special remarks. For instance, 'The child received a stern lecture (and he deserved it).' In mathematical expressions, parentheses denote priority in the order of operations. Parts of the expression enclosed in parentheses are to be calculated first, and the result used in the rest of the expression. For instance, in this expression: 5 + 2 x 5 = 15 Multiplication is peformed before addition, according to the standard order of operations. However, in this expression: ( 5 + 2 ) x 5 = 35 The addition inside the parentheses is performed first, and the sum is then used in the rest of the expression. This kind of math expression, where the result depends upon the position of parentheses, is called non-associative. In many computer programming languages, parentheses have a special purpose. For example, they are frequently used to enclose arguments to functions and methods. In languages such as Lisp, parentheses are used to define an s-expression. In regular expressions, parentheses are used for pattern grouping and capturing. In spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel, parentheses are used in formulas. When introducing an acronym for the first time that may not be known by the reader parentheses may be used to contain the full form. For example, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). Parentheses in computer programming Below is an example of how parentheses may be used in an if statement, using the Perl programming language. if ($test =~ /[a-zA-z /)   print 'It works! ';   Regular expression parentheses With regular expressions, parentheses can be used to capture text. For example, in the below regular expression done in Perl the variable $piglatin takes anything beginning with 'th' and moves it to the end of the line. $piglatin =~ s/^(th)(.*)/ 2 1/i; Parentheses in spreadsheet formulas The following example shows how a formula using parentheses may appear in Microsoft Excel. In the example below, the formula adds cells A1 through A5 to get a total sum. =sum(a1:a5) Programming terms Parse To parse data or information means to break it down into component parts so that its syntax can be analyzed, categorized, and understood. If an error occurs while parsing information a parse error is generated. A parse error may happen for any of the following reasons. Reasons why a parse error may happen The file containing the data to be parsed does not exist. The data to be parsed contains an error. If you downloaded the file causing the parse error, try downloading the file again or look for an updated version of the file. If possible, try downloading the file from a different site. You may have insufficient permissions to access the file's data. The file's data is not compatible with the version of your operating system or program. Insufficient disk space. If a file is being written to a drive (e.g., thumb drive or SD card) that does not have enough space for the parsed results a parse error is generated. Make sure the drive has enough space or move the file being parsed or run to your hard drive if it is being run from removable media. Parse error with Excel or another spreadsheet formula A parse error can also be encountered with a spreadsheet formula if the formula is not formatted correctly. Formula parse errors may happen when extraneous special characters are included in the formula, such as an extra quote. In general, any syntax error in the formula will cause a parse error. Error, Programming terms, Strip Partition When referring to a computer hard drive, a disk partition or partition is a section of the hard drive that is separated from other segments. Partitions enable users to divide a physical disk into logical sections. For example, allowing multiple operating systems to run on the same device. With older file allocation tables, such as FAT 16, creating smaller partitions allows a computer hard drive to run more efficiently and save more disk space. However, with new file allocation tables, such as FAT32, this is no longer the case. What does a partition look like? The best way to see what a partition looks like is to open the disk management tool. Press the Windows key, type Disk Management, and then press Enter. Note A small amount of disk space allocated to a partition is unusable space and cannot be used to store data. For example, the picture below shows the Extra Volume (E:) drive, or partition, having a capacity of 5.86 GB, but the Free Space available for storing data is only 5.84 GB. The 20 MB (.02 GB) difference is space that is unusable. Types of partitions There are also dozens of different partition types. Below is a listing of some of these partitions with a brief description. Some of these partitions may not be available in your partition utility.

High-level language, Pascal case, Pascaline, Procedural language, Programming language, Programming terms Pastebin Alternatively referred to as nopaste, a pastebin is a website for pasting information online and is useful way to quickly share text, code, or other data online. For example, instead of pasting dozens of lines of code in a chat room you can paste a single link of what you want someone to see in chat. Pasting a lot of text directly into a chat room can cause you to be kicked and can disrupt others conversations. Such paste sites also have other benefits, such as for users who cannot send or receive files directly due to a firewall or other connection issues. Related pages An example of a popular pasting site is https://pastebin.com. Chat terms, Data dump, GitHub, Paste, Programming terms Pseudocode Pseudocode may refer to any of the following: 1. Alternatively referred to as p-code, pseudocode is a computer programming language that resembles plain English that cannot be compiled or executed, but explains a resolution to a problem. 2. P-Code is also short for packed code, which is a proprietary language developed by Microsoft. It helps developers create smaller DLLs and application files, by compiling Visual Basic and Visual C++ code into machine code. Since the introduction of the .NET framework Microsoft's P-Code is no longer used.

Computer abbreviations, CPAN, PHP, Programming terms Perl Perl may refer to any of the following: 1. Perl is an interpreted, free, open source programming language first developed by Larry Wall in 1987. It is very similar in structure to the C language. Perl is one of the more commonly used languages in writing CGI scripts and programming for Internet and web page applications. Below is an example of a Perl script that prints 'Hello World!'. #!/usr/bin/perl print 'Hello World! '; Files that include Perl code on a web server may have any file extension, however, commonly they end in .CGI, .PL, or .PLX. If you're running a Linux distro, often Perl will already be installed on the computer. However, if you're using macOS or Microsoft Windows, you'll need to download and install a Perl client. We recommend ActiveState or Strawberry for Perl, found on the links below. Note Perl is not an acronym, but is often referred to the backronym 'Practical Extraction and Reporting Language.' 2.

It was designed for creating dynamic web pages and web pages that effectively work with databases. Below are two examples of how you'd print 'Hello World' using PHP in a .php file. <? print('Hello World!') ?> <? echo 'Hello world'; ?> Files that include PHP code on a web server may have any file extension, but most commonly they end in .PHP, .PHP3, or .PHTML. A PHP file can be created and the contents can be viewed by using a programming code editing program, such as Dreamweaver or Notepad++. Related pages Programming language history. ASP, CGI, Computer acronyms, PEAR, Perl, Programming terms, Server-side scripting, Web design terms Phrase tag In HTML, a phrase tag is used to indicate that a block of text has structural meaning. For example, using the <abbr> tag indicates that the word or phrase contained within is an abbreviation or acronym. Full list of HTML phrase tags Block of text, Programming terms, Tag Pick Originally known as GIRLS (Generalized Information Retrieval Language and System), Pick is a DBMS (database management system). Available today on Unix-like and Windows systems, it was developed in 1965 at the TRW Corporation for the U.S. Army engineers. Database, Programming terms Pickling When referring to the programming language Python, pickling is a term that coders use when talking about object serialization. Pickle is a mechanism for serializing objects, so when a programmer is using pickle to serialize an object, they are said to be pickling, or Python pickling. Conversely, if a programmer is deserializing an object, he or she is said to be unpickling. Programming terms PicoJava PicoJava is a specification for microprocessors that allows Java code to be run without the need for a JIT or an interpreter. The goal of this is to help speed up the execution of Java code. Rather than containing I/O interface or memory logic, this is left to the programmer so that it can be dealt with in a customized fashion. It was not widely implemented by Sun Microsystems when picoJava was developed, but was subsequently commercially licensed. Java, JIT, Programming terms, Sun Pipe A pipe may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to computer memory, a pipe is a temporary section of computer memory capable of linking two or more computer processors to increase the overall efficiency of the computer. Related pages Computer memory help and support. 2. Alternatively referred to as a vertical bar, the pipe is a computer keyboard key '|' that is two vertical lines above one another and commonly looks like a full vertical line. This symbol is found on the same United States QWERTY keyboard key as the backslash key. Where is the pipe on the keyboard? Below is an overview of a computer keyboard with the pipe key highlighted in blue. It is also not uncommon for this key to be directly below the Backspace key and above the Enter key. How to create a pipe Creating the | symbol on a U.S. keyboard On English PC and Mac keyboards, the pipe is on the same key as the backslash key, above the Enter key (Return key) and below the Backspace key. Pressing and holding down the Shift key while pressing the pipe key creates a pipe. Creating the | symbol on a smartphone or tablet To create a quote symbol on a smartphone or tablet, open the keyboard and go into the numbers (123) and then (#+=) or symbols (sym) section and then press your finger on the | symbol. What is a pipe used for on a computer? Computer programming In programming, the double pipe '||' is used to represent an OR boolean operator. Using a pipe as a delimiter It is also not uncommon for one or more pipe characters to be used as a delimiter in a text file because it is not commonly used. Command separator When using the pipe in a command it can be used in MS-DOS, Windows command line, and in the Linux console to display a command or a commands output one page at a time. For example, typing dir | more would display the output of the dir command one page a time. Keyboard terms, Memory terms, Plumbing, Programming terms Pixel shader In computer graphics, a pixel shader, also known as a fragment shader, is a program that dictates the color, brightness, contrast, and other characteristics of a single pixel (fragment). A programmer who specializes is writing pixel shader programs is known as a shading artist. How does it work? The shader itself refers to code that determines how a pixel will appear in a representation of a virtual environment. For instance, if the pixel to be rendered is on the visible surface of the sphere, some of the factors to be considered are: What light sources illuminate this fragment of the sphere and what types of light are they? What color is the light? What is the specularity of the sphere's surface material — does it reflect light sharply like metal, or does it diffuse it like plastic? Is there a texture mapped to the surface? If so, the corresponding pixel in the texture's bitmap will contribute to the color of the fragment. Is there a bump map associated with the surface of the sphere? If so, a bitmap or mathematical procedure will affect the brightness of the light to simulate a bumpy texture on the surface. Is the surface partially transparent? Are there partially transparent objects between the sphere and the camera? Do any other objects cast shadows on the sphere? Programming terms, Texture mapping POD POD may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to Perl, POD is short for plain old documentation and is a simple markup language that allows programmers to add documentation or blocks of comments to their Perl programs. For example, in the below Perl code that prints 'Hello World!' Perl ignores the POD at the end of the script. The POD starts with the '=pod' and then ends with '=cut'. #!/usr/bin/perl #Example of using pod for blocks of comments print 'Hello World!'; =pod Example text part of the pod and is ignored when Perl runs the script. It can be multiple lines and contain any text and keeps going until it sees the cut line. =cut 2. Short for print on demand, POD is used to describe a technique used by publishers who print books based on demand and not on speculation of demand. 3. POD is an abbreviation used for podcast. 4. Computer racing game, POD was one of the first games released that supported Intel's MMX technology and was included with many computers that first shipped with MMX as a demonstration. Computer acronyms, Perl, Programming terms Pointer A pointer may refer to any of the following: 1. In general, pointer is a term used to describe a suggestion, tip, or a hint about a particular product or subject. Related pages Listing of computer tips and pointers. 2. When referring to a mouse, see mouse pointer. 3. When referring to programming, a pointer commonly refers to a reference made to an address in memory of another variable. Memory terms, Programming terms Polymorphism In computer science, polymorphism refers to the ability of a programming language to interpret objects in different ways based on their class or data type. In essence, it is the ability of a single method to be applied to derived classes and achieve a proper output. Tip You can remember this word by breaking it down. The word 'poly' means 'many' and 'morph' means 'form.' Three branches of polymorphism Ad hoc polymorphism is when a function is implemented differently depending on a limited number of specified types and combinations of input parameters. An example of ad hoc polymorphism is function overloading. is when a function is implemented differently depending on a limited number of specified types and combinations of input parameters. An example of ad hoc polymorphism is function overloading. Parametric polymorphism is when code is written without any specification of type, and so can be used with any number of different types specified later. In object-oriented programming, this is often called generic programming. is when code is written without any specification of type, and so can be used with any number of different types specified later. In object-oriented programming, this is often called generic programming. Inclusion polymorphism, also known as subtyping, is when a single name can refer to instances of any number of different classes as long as they share the same superclass. Polymorphism example in Java Example code class OverloadedObject   void overloadedMethod (int a)   System.out.println('This method is called when the parameter is an integer. a = ' + a);   void overloadedMethod (int a, int b)   System.out.println('This method is called when there are two parameters, and they are both integers. a = ' + a + ', b = ' + b);   void overloadedMethod (double a)   System.out.println('This method is called when there is one parameter, and it is a double-precision number. a = ' + a);     class DemonstrateOverloading   public static void main (String args [ )   OverloadedObject myObj = new OverloadedObject(); myObj.overloadedMethod(1); myObj.overloadedMethod(2, 3); myObj.overloadedMethod(4);     Example code output This method is called when the parameter is an integer. a = 1 This method is called when there are two parameters, and they are both integers. a = 2, b = 3 This method is called when the parameter is a double-precision number. a = 4 Notice that it produces different output based on different input parameters, even though the class and method name invoked are the same each time. Object-oriented, Output, Parameter, Polymorphic virus, Programming language, Programming terms POP POP may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for post office protocol, POP or POP mail is one of the most commonly used protocols used to receive e-mail on many e-mail clients. There are two different versions of POP: POP2 and POP3. POP2 was an early standard of POP that was only capable of receiving e-mail and required SMTP to send e-mail. POP3 is the latest standard and can send and receive e-mail only using POP, but can also be used to receive e-mail and then use SMTP to send e-mail. Tip If you are looking for your POP address or POP server, this information is only obtainable from your ISP or e-mail provider. 2. Short for point of presence, POP is a physical location within a telecommunications provider that an ISP uses to house its network servers, routers, etc. A POP allows them to connect to the Internet and share that connection with their clients. 3. In programming, pop is a function for removing an element from the end of an array. For example, in the Perl code below pop removes 'three' from the end of the array to make it 'one two'. my @example = ('one', 'two', 'three'); my $lastexample = pop @example; print '$lastexample '; #Prints: three print '@example'; #Prints: one two Tip If you want to add to the end of an array, use the push function or use unshift to add one or more elements to the beginning of an array. 4. The term pop is used as an alternative way of saying respawn in a game. Computer acronyms, E-mail terms, Game terms, IMAP, Network terms, Popd, Protocol Positional parameter A positional parameter is an argument specified on the command line, used to launch the current process in a shell. Positional parameter values are stored in a special set of variables maintained by the shell. Variables which store positional parameters A typical example of a shell that uses positional parameters is bash. You can use bash on Linux, BSD, macOS X, and Windows 10. Consider the following bash command. The command name is mycommand. The command line has three parameters: one, two, and three four. mycommand one two 'three four' Tip Positional parameters are delimited by a space. The shell interprets the things after the spaces as individual parameters. If the parameter itself contains a space, enclose it in quotation marks, as in 'three four,' above. While mycommand is running, bash provides it with the following shell variables: Variable name Value $0 mycommand $1 one $2 two $3 three four $# 3 [email protected  one two three four $* one two three four The variable $0 is set to the first word of the command — the command name. This variable is useful because commands can be renamed, or executed using a symbolic link. Some programs behave differently depending on the command name used to run the program. $0 allows a program to see what command name launched it. The variables $1, $2, and $3 contain the values of the first, second, and third parameters, respectively. If there was a fourth parameter, its value would be placed in the variable $4. Parameters greater than 9 can be accessed by using curly braces around the number; for instance, $ 10  would be the tenth parameter, and $ 123  would be the 123rd. The variable $# contains the number of positional parameters, excluding $0. The variable [email protected  contains the value of all positional parameters, excluding $0. The variable $* is the same as [email protected , except when it is double-quoted. When enclosed in double quotes, $* expands to $1c$2c$3c... where c is the first character of $IFS, bash's internal field separator variable. The IFS is used for word splitting, and its default value is 'space, tab, or newline' — this is where bash sees the end of one word and the beginning of the next. If the value of $IFS is '_' (an underscore), '[email protected ' expands to: one two three four Whereas '$*' expands to: one_two_three four Examples Here are some examples of using positional parameters in bash. Using the set built-in command, the value of [email protected  can be modified for the current shell. Everything after set -- will be registered as a positional parameter. set -- one two 'three four' Now we can iterate over these variables using for ... in: for arg in [email protected ; do echo '$arg'; done one two three four In bash, [email protected  is the default list to iterate when you run for, so this command also works: for arg; do echo '$arg'; done one two three four Iterating over '$*' (with double quotes) will provide a concatenated string of positional parameters, joined with the first character of $IFS: IFS=','; for arg in '$*'; do echo '$arg'; done one,two,three four For more information, see the documentation of the bash command shell.

In general, private refers to anything that is secret or hidden from something else. 2. In OOP (object-oriented programming), a private class is one that only allows methods that are a part of the class to access its private members. These private members may include variables, properties, and methods. A private class can help keep certain information and code from being accessed or updated (perhaps accidentally) by other parts of the program. Class, OOP, Privacy, Programming terms, Public, Security terms Process A process may refer to any of the following: 1. A process or running process refers to a set of instructions currently being processed by the computer processor. For example, in Windows you can see each of the processes running by opening the Processes tab in Task Manager. Windows Processes are Windows Services and background programs you normally don't see running on the computer. A process may be a printer program that runs in the background and monitors the ink levels and other printer settings while the computer is running. A typical computer has dozens of processes running all of the time to help manage the operating system, its hardware, and the software running on the computer. Related pages Use the Computer Hope process tool for help with identifying processes running on your computer. Computer CPU help and support. 2. Process is also the act of manipulating, altering, or viewing data. 3. In general, process refers to a set of predetermined rules in place that must be followed. CPU terms, End Process, Idle process, PID, Process management, Programming terms, Pts, Task Procedural language A procedural language is a computer programming language that follows, in order, a set of commands. Examples of computer procedural languages are BASIC, C, FORTRAN, Java, and Pascal. Procedural languages are some of the common types of programming languages used by script and software programmers. They make use of functions, conditional statements, and variables to create programs that allow a computer to calculate and display a desired output. Using a procedural language to create a program can be accomplished by using a programming editor or IDE, like Adobe Dreamweaver, Eclipse, or Microsoft Visual Studio. These editors help users develop programming code using one or more procedural languages, test the code, and fix bugs in the code. Declarative programming, Imperative programming, Programming terms Program generator Software program that enables an individual to create a program of their own with less effort and programming knowledge. With a program generator, a user may only be required to specify the steps or rules required for his or her program, and need to write very little code, or none at all. Related pages Some great examples of program generators include Adventure Maker, Alice, and YoYo Games. Programming terms Program listing A program listing may refer to any of the following: 1. In general, a program list may refer to a listing of computer software programs or applications. Tip You can find a listing of installed programs in Windows through the Add or Remove Programs. 2. With computer programming, a program listing is the complete listing of a computer program, source code, and all files that make up the software program. Programming terms, Source code Programmer A programmer may refer to any of the following: 1. Alternatively referred to as a coder or software developer, a programmer is an individual who writes code or creates software for a living. Many programmers who program for a profession have a college degree in computer science. While each job differs, most programmers are responsible for creating the software program or parts of a program, debugging problems, or adding onto a program. Who was the first computer programmer? Ada Lovelace is credited as being the world's first computer programmer. 2. Programmer is the Danish translation for the Windows Program Files folder. Business terms, Consultant, Developer, Engineer, Program, Programming, Programming language, Programming terms, System analyst, Technician Program Program may refer to any of the following: 1. As a verb, program or programming is a term used to describe the process of a programmer developing a software program by programming. 2. As a noun, an application, application software, or program is software on the computer that performs a specific function or task. For example, Microsoft Word is a word processing application that allows users to create and write documents, and a browser, such as the one you are using to view this page, is an application. Apps vs. programs When Apple introduced the iPhone, they popularized the term 'App,' but an app (application) and program are the same thing. Today, most people think of an 'app' as an application on an Apple computer, smartphone, or tablet and a program as something that runs on a computer (e.g., a Windows computer). Tip With all the different ways companies and people use these terms, it is best to think of an application, app, and program as the same thing. See our app page for further information on mobile apps. Programs vs. scripts When a program is created, it is compiled into a language that the computer can understand. Once compiled, the program does not need any other programs to run as long it as the computer has the required operating system and platform. A script is not compiled and needs an interpreter to translate the script into something the computer understands. Without an interpreter, the script cannot run on the computer, but once installed a script can run on any platform without needing to be re-written. See our script term for further information and the pros and cons of scripts. What type of files are program files? A program file must be an executable file and for software programs running Microsoft Windows end with a file extension of .EXE, .COM, or .PIF. Executing these files runs the program and allows it to be used on the computer. On an Apple Macintosh computer, a program ends with .APP. Examples of computer programs There are millions of different programs available for computers, phones, and other devices today. Below are a few examples and the related program category. Tip If you visit the program category page, you can see other examples of programs of that category. See our software page for information on software that is considered a program and software that is a different category. What is the purpose of a program? Without application software (programs) your computer would be able to operate with the operating system (system software) but would not be capable of doing anything else. A program gives the computer and user the ability to perform specific tasks. For example, to browse the Internet on a computer, you would install a browser, which is a program that instructs the computer how to visit, display, and navigate a web page. Without a browser program, the computer would not be able to browse the Internet. What are the basic functions of a program? The functions of a program vary depending on the type of program. For example, the function of a browser program is to browse the Internet. The function of a word processor is to create, view, and edit documents. A program is usually designed to perform a specific task (function), and only that task. In other words, a word processor program may be able to create a document, but it cannot be used to browse the Internet. Tip See our program examples for a list of different types of programs and program categories. Note Today, with cloud computing and online services it may be confusing to know how to define a service such as Google Docs. Google Docs is a word processor, but it is a word processor capable of running through the browser and therefore is considered a web-based application and not a program. Are games programs? Yes, games are programs, but may be labeled as 'games' and not 'programs,' to distinguish them as designed for leisure rather than productivity. As a category of programs, games have subcategories of their own, such as FPS, MMO, and RPG. For example, Quake is an 'FPS game.' Is Microsoft Windows a program? No. All versions of Microsoft Windows are considered an operating system and not a program. What was the first program? The first software program that was held in electronic memory was written by Tom Kilburn. The program calculated the highest factor of the integer 218 = 262,144, and was successfully executed on June 21, 1948, at the University of Manchester, England. The computer was called the SSEM (Small Scale Experimental Machine), otherwise known as the 'Manchester Baby.'. This event is widely celebrated as the birth of software. 3. Program is the Swedish translation for the Windows Program Files folder. Application, File, Program logic, Programmable, Programming language, Programming terms, Software terms, Utility Programmable Term used to describe the ability of a software program or hardware device to properly follow a set of coded instructions. For example, some keyboards have special keys on them that may be programmed to open a web browser or e-mail client. All computers today are considered programmable; whereas some of the earliest models were only capable of performing certain calculations. Related pages History of computers. Program, Programmer, Programming terms Programming language A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute. Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script. Types of programming languages Each of the different programming languages mentioned in the next section can be broken into one or more of the following types (paradigms) of languages. Note There are dozens of other paradigms that can be used to classify a programming language. We've tried to list only the most common as a starting point. Tip A language can also be broken into one of five generation languages. List of computer programming languages Today, there are hundreds of different programming languages. The following section contains an index of the different programming and scripting languages currently listed on our site. Clicking on any of the following languages displays an explanation and examples of that language. Note Languages marked with an asterisk (*) in the list above are not technically a programming language; they are markup, style sheet, and database management languages that are included in the list for those who may consider them as a programming language. Those new to computer programming may find the list above overwhelming. Figuring out where to start depends on the type of computer programming you want to do. The next section is a listing of some of the different fields of programming, as well as the languages to consider for each. Note There are several programming languages listed above that may not be in the following categories. The reason for this is that we have elected to list only the most popular choices to avoid confusion. Applications and program development Application and program development involves programs you work with on a daily basis. For example, the Internet browser you are using to view this web page is considered a program. If you are interested in developing a program, you should consider the following languages: Artificial intelligence development Artificial intelligence or related fields involve creating the character interactions in computer games, portions of programs that make decisions, chatbots, and more. If you're interested in developing an AI, you should consider the following languages: Database development Database developers create and maintain databases. If you're interested in creating or maintaining a database, you should consider any of the following languages: Game development Game development involves creating computer games or other entertainment software. If you're interested in developing a game, you should consider the following languages: Computer drivers or other hardware development Computer drivers and programming hardware interface support are a necessity for hardware functionality. If you're interested in developing drivers or software interfaces for hardware devices, you should consider the following languages: Internet and web page development Internet and web page development are the essence of the Internet. Without developers, the Internet would not exist. If you're interested in creating web pages, Internet applications, or other Internet-related tasks, you should consider the following languages: Script development Although it is not likely to become a career, knowing how to create and develop scripts can increase productivity for you or your company, saving you countless hours. If you're interested in developing scripts, consider the following languages: How many programming languages are there? As computers have evolved, many different computer programming languages created for various types of development. Although we do have several dozen languages listed on our site, there are hundreds that we don't have listed. To get an idea of the different programming languages, you can visit The Hello World Collection, which gives a demo of how to write 'Hello World' in over 591 different programming languages. What are the top programming languages? There are many different ways this question could be answered. However, we feel that the best method is to rely on the data from GitHub, a service that hosts over 96 million different software projects. In the below chart, GitHub shows the top 10 programming languages from 2014 to 2018. In the chart above, you can see the top 10 languages are: JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP, C++, C#, TypeScript, Shell, C, and Ruby. The complete overview of growing languages list is on the GitHub Octoverse page. Tip If you're learning to program, we recommend learning the language that will suit your needs or that others in your industry rather than the most popular language. Hello World, OOPL, Programming, Programming terms Programming Programming is the act of an individual writing code (a set of instructions) that are to be interpreted and executed by a computer or another electronic device. These instructions can create programs, as well as tell applications how to operate or function. People who program are referred to as programmers and write their code in a programming language.

For example, a compiler is an example of a programming tool. Programming terms, Tools Prolog Short for programming in logic or programation et logique (French), prolog is a programming language developed by Alain Colmeraur and his colleagues at the University of Marseilles in 1972. Prolog is commonly used for AI, and unlike other programming languages, Prolog is based on a set of rules instead of instructions. Related pages Programming language history. AI, Artificial intelligence terms, Computer abbreviations, Program logic, Programming terms Pseudo-class A pseudo-class is an element of CSS coding that adds conditions to a class. When a pseudo-class is added, specific parameters must be met for the instructions to be executed. For a pseudo-class to be added to a CSS rule, it must immediately be followed by a colon (:), followed by the name of the pseudo-class.

They are not truly random, because when a computer is functioning correctly, nothing it does is random. Computers are deterministic devices — a computer's behavior is entirely predictable, by design. So to create something unpredictable, computers use mathematical algorithms to produce numbers that are 'random enough.' When are pseudo-random numbers used? Pseudo-random numbers are essential to many computer applications, such as games and security. In games, random numbers provide unpredictable elements the player can respond to, such as dodging a random bullet or drawing a card from the top of a deck. In computer security, pseudo-randomness is important in encryption algorithms, which create codes that must not be predicted or guessed. What is a PRNG? A pseudo-random number generator, or PRNG, is any program, or function, which uses math to simulate randomness. It may also be called a DRNG (digital random number generator), or DRBG (deterministic random bit generator). The math can sometimes be complex, but in general, using a PRNG requires only two steps: Provide the PRNG with an arbitrary seed. Ask for the next random number. The seed value is a 'starting point' for creating random numbers. The value is used when computing the numbers. If the seed value changes, the generated numbers also change, and a single seed value will always produce the same numbers. For this reason, the numbers aren't really random, because true randomness could never be re-created. The current time is often used as a unique seed value. For instance, if it's March 5, 2018, at 5:03 P.M. and 7.01324 seconds UTC, that can be expressed as an integer. That precise time will never occur again, so a PRNG with that seed should produce a unique set of random numbers. Note Being able to reproduce a randomly-generated sequence can be useful. In academic applications, a massive sequence of random values can be generated for a simulation, then reproduced exactly for more detailed analysis later. As another example, in computer games, if a player loads a saved game, any 'random' events can be the same as if the game never stopped. That way, the player can't reload the same game repeatedly to try for better luck. How to generate pseudo-random number The following are some ways you can create a pseudo-random number in common programs and programming languages. Windows Command Prompt At the Windows command prompt, or in a batch file, the special environment variable %RANDOM% produces a pseudo-random number between 0 and 32767, seeded with the time the command prompt launched. echo 'So %RANDOM%!' 'So 27525!' To create a batch file that generates a random number between 1 and 100: copy con sorandom.bat echo off set /a myrand=%RANDOM%*100/32768+1 echo The number I was thinking of was %myrand%. Did you get it right? Press Ctrl+Z and Enter to save the batch file. Then, execute the file: sorandom The number I was thinking of was 91. Did you get it right? Windows PowerShell The Get-Random cmdlet generates a random number between 0 and 2,147,483,647 (the maximum value of an unsigned 32-bit integer). Get-Random 1333190525 The cmdlet takes a number of options, such as a minimum and maximum value. Values are rounded down, so to generate a number between 1 and 100, set the maximum to 101: Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 101 99 Microsoft Excel In an Excel spreadsheet, the formula =RAND() will generate a random number between 0 and 1. For instance, if you highlight a cell and enter =RAND(), the cell will contain a number that will change whenever the sheet is re-calculated. This method also works in other spreadsheet applications, including LibreOffice Calc and Google Sheets. In programming languages Most programming languages have their own PRNG functions. Here are some common examples: C In the C programming language, the PRNG functions are defined in the standard library, stdlib. The common way to seed the random generator is with the time() function, declared in time.h. The generated number falls between 0 and the constant RAND_MAX, a system-specific integer guaranteed to be at least 32767. #include <time.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> void main ()   srand(time(NULL));   seed the generator */ int rand1 = rand();   a pseudorandom integer between 0 and RAND_MAX */ printf('Random number between 0 and %d: %d ', RAND_MAX, (int)rand1);   Or, within a specific range: */ int min = 0; int max = 100; float rand2 = (float)rand() * max / RAND_MAX + 1; int round = (int)rand2; printf('Random number between %d and %d: %d (%f) ', min, max, round, rand2); return;   Output: Random number between 0 and 2147483647: 1789080047 Random number between 0 and 100: 74 (74.369179) C++ In C++: #include <ctime> #include <cstdlib> #include <iostream> int main ()   srand(time(NULL)); std::cout << 'Random number between 0 and ' << RAND_MAX << ': ' << rand() << ' ' << 'Random number between 1 and 100: ' << (rand() % 100) + 1 << std::endl; return 0;   Output: Random number between 0 and 2147483647: 126569208 Random number between 1 and 100: 9 Python 3 The random module in Python offers a variety of functions for generating random numbers. In this example, we use three different methods for finding a random integer in a range. import random from datetime import datetime random.seed(datetime.now()) print('Random number in range [0,1): ', random.random()) # Within a range. These all do the same thing: print('Random number between 1 and 100: ', round(random.random() * 100) + 1) print('Random number between 1 and 100: ', random.randrange(1, 101)) print('Random number between 1 and 100: ', random.randint(1, 100)) Output: Random number in range [0,1): 0.05137418896158319 Random number between 1 and 100: 27 Random number between 1 and 100: 80 Random number between 1 and 100: 80 Perl 5 In Perl: srand(time); # changes once per second print 'Random number in range [0,1): ', rand(), ' '; print 'Random number in range [1, 100 : ', int(rand(101)), ' '; Output: Random number in range [0,1): 0.691379946963028 Random number in range [0, 100 : 82 JavaScript console.log('Random number in range [0,1): ' + Math.random()); console.log('Random number in range [1,100 : ' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 101)); View the output in your web browser's JavaScript console (for instance, in Firefox press Ctrl+Shift+K): Random number in range [0,1): 0.305008216755414 Random number in range [1,100 : 8 Note: It's not possible to seed the Math.random() function in JavaScript. If you need a robust PRNG in JavaScript, check out better random numbers for JavaScript on GitHub. Example PRNG: JavaScript widget Using the widget below, you can seed a PRNG and use it to generate random numbers. Each time you generate a random number from your given seed, its offset increases by 1. The first number generated from the seed has offset zero, the second has offset 1, etc. The generator always produces the same number for a given seed and offset. Enter anything you want into the field to create a unique seed. Use the Generate button to get the next random number using that seed, and increment the offset. Use the Reset button to reset the offset to zero. Input a custom seed (a number or phrase): Generate! number generated from seed : Reset seed offset (currently 0) This widget uses Johannes Baagøe's open source PRNG scripts, Alea.js and Mash.js.

In general, public refers to anything that is out in the open for everyone to see. 2. In object-oriented programming, a public class is one where any part of the program can access or update its members by using the name of the member that is to be accessed. This type of class is useful for information or methods that need to be available in any part of the program code. Class, Private, Programming terms Push Push may refer to any of the following: 1. In general, push refers to the action of pressing down on something. For example, with a push-button you are pressing down on a button either physically (e.g., a power button) or virtually in a software program (e.g., clicking the back button in a browser). 2. In programming, push is a function that can add one or more elements to the end of an array. For example, in the Perl code below push adds 'three' to the end of the array to make it 'one two three'. With push, you could also push a variable to the end of an array or combine arrays by pushing another array to the end of an array. my @example = ('one', 'two'); push @example, 'three'; print '@example'; #Prints: one two three Tip You can use shift to remove the first element of an array or use pop to remove the last element of an array. 3. With Git, push is a term that describes the process of sending (uploading) the updates you've done in your local repository to a Git remote repository. In contrast, pull is the process of downloading the files in a remote repository to your local Git repository. 4. Push is another name for a back quote. 5. Push may also be used to describe push technology, which is used with Internet communication. Programming terms, Pushd, Push notification Python Python may refer to any of the following: 1. Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that was first developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989 and released in 1991.

Chat terms, Programming terms, QFT R programming language R may refer to any of the following: 1. The R programming language is a computer programming language and software environment for statistical computing. Statisticians and data miners widely use it to perform complex analysis. R was first introduced in 1993; created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand as an implementation of the S programming language. Like S, which was developed by John Chambers while he was at Bell Labs in the late 1970s, R was created to 'turn ideas into software quickly and faithfully.' R is an interpreted language, and its principle user interface is a command line. Native data structures of R include vectors, scalars, matrices, lists, and data frames, which are similar to a table in a relational database. R performs matrix arithmetic, benchmarking competitively with software packages, such as MATLAB. R supports generic functions, in which a function performs the same general procedure for multiple types of input data. For instance, R's print() function can be passed any manner of variable, and automatically invokes the correct method for printing that type of data. As such, 'Hello World' in R is a very simple program. print('Hello, World!') 2. The letter 'r' is also chatslang for 'are'. For example, 'r u serious' in chat is short for 'are you serious.' Programming language, Programming terms Race condition A race condition or race hazard is a scenario in an electronic processing system where the result of a calculation might be affected by an unforeseen or uncontrolled sequence of events. The underlying concept is that the results of a process should never be affected by one of the operations 'winning a race' (finishing first). Race condition example Consider the following set of operations: variable a = 1 variable a = a * 5 variable b = a - 1 If these operations are processed in the proper sequence, variable b should equal 4. But if operation 3 is executed before operation 2 has completed, b would equal 0. Race conditions in Processors Race conditions are an important problem in CPU design that use both parallel and concurrent processing techniques to execute multiple instructions in an overlapping time frame. To ensure that the output of calculations is not corrupted, race conditions must always be anticipated and avoided. Race conditions in Software It's also an important problem for software developers, who must handle any race conditions that may occur when their code is used in real-world situations. Famously, an improperly handled race condition in the software of NASA's Spirit exploration rover nearly resulted in the rover being lost shortly after it landed on Mars. Design, Parallel processing, Programming terms Racket Racket is a general purpose programming language derived from Lisp. It is referred to as a 'programmable programming language' because its built-in macro system is so powerful that it allows a programmer to redefine everything about the language itself. For this reason, Racket is often used to design and implement custom programming languages for specific project needs. Racket was originally developed as part of the PLT ('programming language team') project by computer scientist Matthias Felleisen in 1995. His intention was to create a language which would help novice programmers learn more about the potential of computers. Hello, World! written in Racket (printf 'Hello, World!')

Hello World, Language, Programming terms RAD Short for rapid application development, RAD describes a method of developing software programs through the use of pre-programmed tools or wizards. Although RAD can decrease the time it takes difficulty in developing a program, it may reduce the program's efficiency. Good examples of RAD applications are Visual Basic and Delphi. Application, Computer acronyms, Programming terms Random Any data or information that has no order. For example, 5,8,2,9, and 0 are single-digit numbers that are in random order. Data that is random can be sorted by date, name, time, age, etc. Data can be randomly selected or random numbers can be generated using a random seed. Computer games, web pages, programs, and encryption are a few examples of what needs random values to operate. For example, Computer Hope has a random dictionary definition script that randomly selects and opens a random dictionary page for Computer Hope users. Example of a random number Below is an example of a random number generated from a custom seed. Enter any text into the custom seed box and click the generate button. This widget uses Johannes Baagøe's open source PRNG scripts, Alea.js and Mash.js. Input a custom seed (a number or phrase): Generate! number generated from seed : Reset seed offset (currently 0) Random number in programming In programming languages, there is often a command, function, or random number generator (rng) that allows the developer to generate a pseudo-random number. For example, in Perl, the rand function will return a random number between 0 and a number that you specify. my $random = int(rand(10) + 1); print 'Random number between 1 and 10: $random '; Here, the variable random is assigned a random integer value between zero and ten, rounded down, plus one. The result is a whole number between 1 and 10. Random number in Microsoft Excel You can create a random number in excel by using the rand or randbetween function.

RDF has features that allow data to be merged even if the underlying schemas are different. Additionally, RDF usually supports the evolution of differing schemas over time without requiring all them to be changed from the ground up. How does it work? The Resource Description Framework extends the linking structure between web pages by utilizing URIs to establish a relationship between them, as well as the both ends of a hyperlink. This method allows both structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, viewed, and shared across different applications. The links in this structure form labeled, easy-to-read graphs, where the graph's nodes represent the named link between two resources.

Real numbers include whole numbers (such as 1, 2, 3), rational decimal numbers (32.3), irrational numbers (π), and negative numbers (-4). They are called 'real' to differentiate them from 'imaginary' (or 'complex') numbers, which include a component multiplied by i, the square root of -1. Some real numbers can be difficult to use in computers, which must represent long or nonterminating numbers in a finite number of bits. As a result, some real numbers may be approximated, or rounded, to create a finite, floating-point representation. Number, Programming terms, Scientific notation Recompile Recompile is a term that refers to the act of compiling data or code again after the initial compilation. Below is an example of its use. 'After I fixed the error in my code, I recompiled it.' Compilers like Eclipse and GCC can recompile code. Code, Compilation, Compile, Programming terms Recursion Recursion may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to computer programming, recursion refers to a function or subroutine that calls itself purposely or by mistake. Recursion is commonly performed to solve problems capable of being resolved by deduction; many numeric problems can often be resolved by recursion. 2. When referring to a network or domain name servers, recursion refers to an available option that enables or disables the ability of name servers sending requests from other name servers. In Microsoft DNS server, recursion can be disabled by setting the below registry key to a value of 1. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE SYSTEM CurrentContolSet Services DNS Parameters Programming terms Recursive In computer programming, the term recursive describes a function or method that repeatedly calculates a smaller part of itself to arrive at the final result. It is similar to iteration, but instead of repeating a set of operations, a recursive function accomplishes repetition by referring to itself in its own definition. While the concept of recursive programming can be difficult to grasp initially, mastering it can be very useful. Recursion is one of the fundamental tools of computer science. A classic example is the recursive method for computing the factorial of a number. The factorial of an integer n, which is written as n!, is the result of multiplying n by all of the positive integers less than n. For instance, 3! = 3 x 2 x 1, which results in 6, and 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, which results in 24. An efficient way to calculate a factorial is by using a recursive function. Below is an example of a recursive factorial function written in JavaScript. function factorial(n)   return (n === 0) ? 1 : n * factorial(n-1);   As you can see, part of the definition of the function factorial is the result of factorial performed on a smaller integer. By calling itself, it can multiply the number by each positive number less than it and then return the final result. Recursive functions can be useful in other calculations, such as calculating Fibonacci numbers or the greatest common divisor. Using recursive logic can have some downfalls, including the creation of an endless loop in programming. For this reason, ensuring there is an escape condition (like a do until) in the programming helps reduce, if not eliminate, the chance of an endless loop from occurring. If an endless loop occurs, it can cause the program to use a lot of memory on a computer, and could cause the program, operating system, or computer to stop functioning. Escape, Function, Loop, Programming terms Regex Short for regular expression, a regex is a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text. Perl is a great example of a programming language that utilizes regular expressions. However, its only one of the many places you can find regular expressions. Regular expressions can also be used from the command line and in text editors to find text within a file. When first trying to understand regular expressions it seems as if it is a different language. However, mastering regular expressions can save you thousands of hours if you work with text or need to parse large amounts of data. Below is an example of a regular expression with each of its components labeled. This regular expression is also shown in the Perl programming examples shown later on this page. The basics of regular expressions (cheat sheet) Looking at the above example may be overwhelming. However, once you understand the basic syntax of how regular expression commands operate you can read the above example just as if you are reading this sentence. Unfortunately, not all programs, commands, and programming languages use the same regular expressions, but they all share similarities. Character What does it do? Example Matches ^ Matches beginning of line ^abc abc, abcdef.., abc123 $ Matches end of line abc$ my:abc, 123abc, theabc . Match any character a.c abc, asg, a2c | OR operator abc|xyz abc or xyz (...) Capture anything matched (a)b(c) Captures 'a' and 'c' (?:...) Non-capturing group (a)b(?:c) Captures 'a' but only groups 'c' [...  Matches anything contained in brackets [abc  a,b, or c [^...  Matches anything not contained in brackets [^abc  xyz, 123, 1de [a-z  Matches any characters between 'a' and 'z' [b-z  bc, mind, xyz  x  The exact 'x' amount of times to match (abc) 2  abcabc  x,  Match 'x' amount of times or more (abc) 2,  abcabc, abcabcabc  x,y  Match between 'x' and 'y' times. (a) 2,4  aa, aaa, aaaaa * Greedy match that matches everything in place of the * ab*c abc, abbcc, abcdc + Matches character before + one or more times a+c ac, aac, aaac, ? Matches the character before the ? zero or one times. Also, used as a non-greedy match ab?c ac, abc   Escape the character after the backslash or create an escape sequence. a sc a c Escape characters (escape sequence) Note escape characters are case sensitive. Character What does it do?   Any character not mentioned below preceded with a   will be escaped. For example,  . matches a period and does not perform the function mentioned above. Characters that should be escaped are () [     ^ $ . | * + ?    0 Null character  a Match a bell or alarm.  b Word boundary in most or backspace  B Non word boundary  d Match any decimal digit (0-9)  D Match any non digit  e Match an escape  f Match a form feed Match a new line  Q... E Ignores any special meaning in what is being matched.  r Match a carriage return  s Matches a space character (space,  t,  r, )  S Matches any non-white space character  t Match a tab  v Match a vertical tab  w Matches any one word character [a-zA-Z_0-9   W Matches any one non word character Regular expression flags Outside the regular expression (at the end) flags can be used to help with the pattern matching. Character What does it do? i Ignore the case (upper and lower case allowed) m Multi-line match s Match new lines x Allow spaces and comments J Duplicate group names allowed U Ungreedy match Perl programming language regular expression examples Below are a few examples of regular expressions and pattern matching in Perl. Many of these examples are similar or the same to other programming languages and programs that support regular expressions. $data =~ s/bad data/good data/i; The above example replaces any 'bad data' with 'good data' using an case-insensitive match. So if the $data variable was 'Here is bad data' it would become 'Here is good data'. $data =~ s/a/A/; This example replaces any lowercase a with an uppercase A. So if $data was 'example' it would become 'exAmple'. $data =~ s/[a-z  /; The above example replaces any lowercase letter, a through z, with an asterisk. So if $data was 'Example' it would become 'E******'. $data =~ s/e$/es/; This example uses the $ character, which tells the regular expression to match the text before it at the end of the string. So if $data was 'example' it would become 'examples'. $data =~ s/ ./!/; In the above example, we are replacing a period with an exclamation mark. Because the period is a meta-character if you only entered a period without the   ( escape) it is treated as any character. In this example, if $data were 'example.' it would become 'example!', however, if you did not have the escape it would replace every character and become '!!!!!!!!' $data =~ s/^e/E/; Finally, in this above example the caret ( ^ ) tells the regular expression to match anything at the beginning of the line. In this example, this would match any lowercase e at the beginning of the line and replace it with a capital E. Therefore, if $data was 'example' it would become 'Example'.

Language, Programming terms Relational algebra Relational algebra is a special form of algebra that describes the data stored in relational databases and the query languages used to access that data. It was first developed by E. F. Codd at IBM and was formally introduced in 1970. Codd's work became the basis for database query languages such as SQL and MySQL. The five primitive operators Set union (∪) - Given multiple sets of data, for instance two sets B and C, the union of the sets B ∪ C is the data that appears in any or in all the sets. (∪) - Given multiple sets of data, for instance two sets B and C, the union of the sets B ∪ C is the data that appears in any or in all the sets. Set difference (∖) - Given two sets of data B and C, the difference of the sets B ∖ C is the data that appears in C but does not appear in B. (∖) - Given two sets of data B and C, the difference of the sets B ∖ C is the data that appears in C but does not appear in B. Cartesian product (×) - Given two sets of data B and C, the Cartesian product B × C is the set of all ordered pairs (b, c) where b is a member of B, and c is a member of C. (×) - Given two sets of data B and C, the Cartesian product B × C is the set of all ordered pairs (b, c) where b is a member of B, and c is a member of C. Selection (σ) - Consider a set of data B, and a formula φ that uses the logical operators and (∧) or (∨) and not (¬). The selection σφ(B) results in all members of B for which the formula φ is true. For instance, suppose that φ is the propositional formula gender=female ∨ (eyeColor=Blue ∧ eyeColor=Hazel) . The selection σφ(Friends) would result in a set that contains all members of Friends who are female and have either blue or hazel eyes. (σ) - Consider a set of data B, and a formula φ that uses the logical operators and (∧) or (∨) and not (¬). The selection σφ(B) results in all members of B for which the formula φ is true. For instance, suppose that φ is the propositional formula . The selection σφ(Friends) would result in a set that contains all members of Friends who are female and have either blue or hazel eyes. Projection (π) - Given a set of data B and a set of attributes a1, a2…, the projection πa1, a2…(R) is the set of all members of B restricted by the a1, a2… attributes. For instance, the projection πfullName, phoneNumber(addressBook) results in a set that contains only the members of addressBook that have the attributes fullName and phoneNumber.

The course was taught in the programming language ALGOL, and assignments were coded on punch cards and processed on a UNIVAC 1108 computer running a custom operating system named CHI. Students had a ritual where they would recite a phrase whenever the time was exactly 11:08. The phrase was, 'It is 11:08; ABS, ALPHABETIC, ARCSIN, ARCCOS, ARCTAN.' These were the first five commands found in the ALGOL manual. They were used for finding an absolute value, defining an alphabetic character, and finding the mathematical values for arcsin, arccosine, and arctangent. Programming language, Programming terms REM Short for remark, REM is a statement that can be placed in system files such as the autoexec.bat or config.sys by placing 'REM' (followed by a space) in front of a line. Doing this would remark the line and not show the line if echo is off. @echo off REM Example line that will not be seen with echo off. Echo Hello World! In the example above, the first line would be skipped, and the batch file would merely echo 'Hello World!' to the screen. Alternatively, you can also place two colons (::) in front of a line to remark a line in a batch file. With two colons the line will not show regardless if echo off is in the batch file. ::This line is never seen Echo Hello World! Comment, Computer abbreviations, Nonexecutable statement, Programming terms Repeat counter A repeat counter is a hardware device or portion of a software program that helps keep track of the amount of times a task is performed. In programming, this may help prevent a continuous loop. Programming terms REPL Short for read-eval-print loop, REPL is the interactive top level of a programming language interpreter or command line shell. It offers the user a simple prompt, accepts expressions, evaluates them, and prints the result. Examples would be shells such as bash or csh, or the interactive interpreter of a language such as Python or Lisp. Computer acronyms, Interpreter, Programming terms Reserved character A reserved character is a letter or symbol that cannot be used because it is being utilized in another location or by the operating system. For example, many operating systems reserve the following characters: ' , /, :, *, ?, ', <, >, and |' and disallow these characters from being used when saving or renaming a file. Character, Programming terms, Reserved word Reserved word A reserved word may refer to any of the following: 1. Often found in programming languages and macros, reserved words are terms or phrases appropriated for special use that may not be utilized in the creation of variable names. For example, 'print' is a reserved word because it is a function in many languages to show text on the screen. 2. Reserved words are used in operating systems as a method of identifying a device file or another service. Below is a listing of Microsoft reserved words in MS-DOS and Windows operating systems. When attempting to use any of the below reserved words as a name of a file, or in a command you may encounter and unusual response. For example, attempting to save a file as CON or CON.txt may generate a reserved file name or access denied error or say the file already exists. Reserved Word What it is AUX Auxiliary port, aka Serial Port COM1. CON Console, which Microsoft describes as the display monitor or keyboard. COM1 COM port COM2 COM port COM3 COM port COM4 COM port LPT1 LPT port LPT2 LPT port LPT3 LPT port. NUL NULL PRN Printer aka LPT1 Device file, Java reserved words, Operating system terms, Programming terms, Reserved character, Word Return address A return address may refer to any of the following: 1. In computer programming, the return address is the location directly after where a subroutine is called. When a return statement is called in a subroutine or the subroutine completes the program goes to the return address and continues running the program. 2. When referring to e-mail and mail, the return address is the address a mail returns if it is not successfully delivered. When sending an e-mail, the return address is your e-mail address or the address entered into the from section of the e-mail. E-mail terms, Joe job, Programming terms, Return, Return statement Return statement In programming, return is a statement that tells the program to leave the subroutine and return to the return address, directly after where the subroutine was called. In most programming languages, the return statement is either return or return value, where value is a variable or other information coming back from the subroutine. Below is an example of how the return statement could be used in the Perl programming language. my $rsexample = 1; print 'Example of a return statement. '; &rsexample; print 'Value now equals: $rsexample '; sub rsexample   $rsexample++; return $rsexample;   In the above example, the rsexample variable is first set as equal to 1 and then when the rsexample subroutine is called that value is increased by 1. When the program returns to the return address the program prints Value now equals: 2. Unlike some other programming languages, if Perl does not have a return statement in the subroutine it returns the statements last value. In the above example, the code would still work the same even if the return statement wasn't in the subroutine. In the example below (using JavaScript), the function returns to the code that called it if the number sent to the function is less than one. function a (num)   if (num < 1)   return;   else   document.write('The number is' + num + '<br />);     a(0); document.write('I like numbers greater than 0'); In this case, the number sent to the function is 0, so the function returns to the code after the function call, and will write the text 'I like numbers greater than 0'. If the number were instead 1, then the text 'The number is 1' would be written first, and the text 'I like numbers greater than 0' would be written below it. If a programming language allows the return statement to return a value back to the code, then the returned value can be used in the code that called the function. The code below (again using JavaScript) shows an example of how this is done. function a (num)   if (num < 1)   return false;   else   return true;     var x = a(0); if (x === true)   document.write('The number is greater than 0');   else   document.write('The number is not greater than 0');   In this case, the result of the function (the return value) is assigned to the variable x. The function returns the value true if the number sent to it is greater than one, and returns the value false otherwise. Since the value sent to the function in this case is 0, the function returns as false. The function continues evaluating the conditional statement, which will write The number is not greater than 0 on the page, because the value returned to the variable x is false. Programming terms, Return, Return address, Subroutine Reverse engineering Reverse engineering may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to computer science/programming, reverse engineering means to 'break down' the programming code. This process involves finding out how various functions in the code are built, what they do, and how each relates to and interacts with other functions in the code. Generally speaking, the purpose is to fix errors in the software engineer's code, or create a program like the one being deconstructed. 2. Manufactured products (both by machine and by hand) can also be reverse engineered. The products are taken apart and dissected to learn and understand how they work mechanically, why they work and what part they play in the functionality of the whole product. Reverse engineering allows variations of existing products that can include improvements as people learn how something works and what could be done to improve on the product. Hardware terms, Program, Programming, Programming terms, Software terms Revision control In the software development process, revision control, also known as version control or source control, is the management of changes made over time. These changes can be to source code, project assets, or any other information that goes into the finished product. It permits many people to work on the same parts of a project without worrying that their changes will overwrite the work of anyone else. The collection of revisions and their metadata is called a repository or repo. The repository represents a step-by-step chronological record of every change made to help project managers revert all or part of the project to a previous state if necessary. How revisions are made Revision control systems are usually hosted on a networked server. After the repository is set up, using it generally involves the following steps: If the developer has created a new file that should become part of the project, the file must be added to the repository. The file is uploaded to the repository, and anyone else working on the project can see and use the file. If the developer wants to edit a file that is already part of the project, the file must be checked out. The act of checking out downloads the desired revision of the file to the developer's local version of the project. Usually, the revision that a developer wants to edit is the most recent revision: this revision is known as the 'head'. After the developer edits the file locally and is ready to add it to the official version of the project, the file can be checked in. This action is also known as making a commit. The developer is asked to write a summary of what changes were made and why. These comments, along with the updated version of the file, are uploaded to the repository. If someone else has checked in revisions to the same file since the last time the developer checked it out, the system announces that there are conflicts. It calculates the differences line-by-line, and the developers who made the changes must agree upon how their individual changes should be merged. The merging is usually done manually: the developers compare the conflicting versions and decide how to resolve them into one document. If there are no conflicts, the new version is updated in the repository, and the entire project receives a new revision number, permanently and uniquely identifying its current state. Branching the development tree Experimental changes are often made to the main version of a software project. Using revision control, these changes can be made to a separate copy of the project without interfering with development of the main version. The terminology for this approach uses the metaphor of a tree: the main version of the project is called the trunk, and experimental versions are known as branches. Centralized vs. distributed systems If a revision control systems uses a centralized repository, its data is contained in a single database that contains the authoritative version of all project files. Other systems employ a distributed model. In these systems, changes can be checked in to any project repository and the repositories synchronize the changes with each other. List of revision control software Branch, Bug tracking, Programming terms, Trunk ROM BASIC With early computers, the ROM BASIC was a ROM interpreter that allowed users to run and create BASIC programs. Today's computers no longer include a BASIC ROM; however, users using IBM compatible computers still may encounter error messages related to the ROM BASIC. Related pages No ROM BASIC system halted error. BASIC, Programming terms, ROM Routine and subroutine A routine or subroutine, also referred to as a function, procedure, and subprogram, is a portion of code that may be called and executed anywhere in a program. For example, a routine may be used to save a file or display the time. Instead of writing the code each time these commonly performed tasks are needed, routines are created and called when these tasks need to be performed. Below is a basic example of a Perl subroutine. Subroutine example &hello; sub hello   print 'Hello World! ';   In the above example, a user could call the hello subroutine (in this example, by typing &hello;) anywhere in the program and have the program print Hello World!. After the subroutine has completed, the program goes to the return address, which is directly after &hello; and runs any additional code. Call, Control flow, DLL, Function, Instance, Programming terms, Return address, Return statement, Stubroutine, Sub Routing algorithm A routing algorithm is a set of step-by-step operations used to direct Internet traffic efficiently. When a packet of data leaves its source, there are many different paths it can take to its destination. The routing algorithm is used to determine mathematically the best path to take. Different routing algorithms use different methods to determine the best path. For example, a distance vector algorithm calculates a graph of all available routes by having each point (called a node) determine the 'cost' of travelling to each immediate neighbor. This information is collected for every node to create a distance table; which is used to determine the best path to from any one node to another. Algorithm, Internet, Network terms, Programming terms, Routing RPG RPG may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for Role Playing Game, RPG is a game where players act out a different reality. On a computer these games are often referred to as CRPG or Computer Role Playing Games. Related pages RPG game listing. 2.

Short for Raster Pattern Generator, RPG is the set of electronic circuits that converts raster patterns into bit patterns. Computer acronyms, D&D, Game terms, MMORPG, Programming terms Ruby Ruby is an open source object-oriented programming language developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto. The first version of the language (0.95) was released in 1995, and in 2011, version 1.9.3 was released. Ruby is gaining popularity, and a framework called Ruby on Rails has helped to increase its usage for web programming. The Ruby language is completely object-oriented, in that everything is an object. For instance, even the most basic data types like integers have methods and instance variables. This provides a greater ability to use method chaining, where many lines of code can be consolidated into one. For example, if you wanted to use three different methods on a string, one way would be to write several lines of code as shown below. x = 'Computer'.reverse y = x.upcase z = y.downcase These methods could instead be chained, as shown in the below code. z = 'Computer'.reverse.upcase.downcase Ruby is also known for being a flexible language, because it allows for programmers to make modifications to various parts of the language if desired. More information on Ruby programming can be found using the resources below. How is Ruby used? The most common use of Ruby is with web applications. Its main appeals is that programmers don't have to spend a lot of time setting up their files. Object-oriented programing, Programming languages, Programming terms, <ruby>, Server-side scripting Run time The term runtime or run time describes the period of time when a program is actually running on a computer. If a computer operation is described as occurring 'at runtime,' it happens while a program is running, or at the moment a program begins to run. Programming terms, Runtime error, Software terms, Time Rust Rust may refer to any of the following: 1. Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports functional, imperative, object-oriented, and concurrent-action programming styles. It began as a personal project by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare and over five years grew to become an open-source project accepting contributions from hundreds of volunteers. Its official description is: 'runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes, and eliminates data races.' Version 1.0.0 alpha was released by Mozilla research on January 9, 2015. More information on Rust The stated goal of Rust is to be a competitive choice for writing client and server applications that communicate over the Internet. As such, it focuses on security, control over the layout of memory, and concurrency. It is memory safe — it does not allow null or dangling pointers (pointers that do not point to the correct type of data), so it avoids problems such as buffer overruns; common in languages like C and C++. It also has strict rules about how and when data values can be initialized. The syntax of Rust is derived from C and C++, but its semantics are very different. Its typing system is similar to the Haskell programming language and permits ad-hoc polymorphism. Hello, World! written in Rust fn main()   println!('Hello, World');   Related pages Programming language history. 2. Rust is a popular video game released by Facepunch Studios in 2013. It's a multiplayer sandbox game where you must survive the wilderness, develop new technologies, build structures, and fight or form alliances with other players. Rust is available for purchase on Steam, and playable on Windows, macOS, and Linux computers. Alpha, Concurrency, Hello World, Language, Paradigm, Programming terms S-expression An s-expression, also known as a sexpr or sexp, is a way to represent a nested list of data. It stands for 'symbolic expression,' and it is commonly encountered in the Lisp programming language and variants of Lisp such as Scheme, Racket, and Clojure. These programming languages use s-expressions to represent the computer program, as well as the program's data. For example, the simple mathematical expression 'five times the sum of seven and three' can be written as a s-expression with prefix notation. In Lisp, the s-expression might look like the example below. (* 5 (+ 7 3)) Computer abbreviations, Expression, Programming terms Safe font In HTML, fonts are considered safe when they work with all Internet browsers. If a font is not safe, it may not display properly, or at all. Some examples of safe fonts for HTML include Arial, Arial Black, Comic Sans MS, Courier, Courier New, Impact, Times New Roman, and Verdana. Font, Google Fonts, Internet browser, Programming terms Sandbox A sandbox may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to computer security, a sandbox is a location in memory partitioned from the rest of the system. The purpose is to create an area where experimental, sensitive, or potentially dangerous code and data may be executed and accessed without affecting the rest of the system. 2. In general, a sandbox can refer to any location on a computer, online service, or network that allows someone to test or experiment without causing problems. Programming terms, Security terms Scala Scala is a programming language introduced in 2003 that is object-oriented, strongly and statically-typed, and supportive of functional programming paradigms. Scala was created to address many criticisms of the Java programming language. As such, it has a syntax similar to Java and compiles to Java bytecode, but with several key differences inspired by languages, such as Scheme and Haskell. Here is 'Hello, World!' written in Scala: object HelloWorld extends App   println('Hello, World!')   Related pages Programming language history. Java, Language, Programming terms Scanf In the C programming language, scanf is short for scan formatted and is a control parameter used to read and store a string of characters. The string is usually read from an input source, but may come from other sources too. The image shows an example of scanf in action. Computer abbreviations, Data type, Parameter, Programming terms Schema matching In computer science, schema matching is the comparison of two objects on the basis of their semantics. If two objects (such as a mathematical equation or a snippet of code) can be matched schematically, they are said to be mappable. That is, you can draw a direct comparison between each of their syntactical components. Computer Science, Programming terms, Schema Scheme programming language Scheme is a programming language that is a variation of Lisp. It was created in 1975 by Guy Steele and Gerry Sussman at MIT's Artificial Intelligence lab. It was the first dialect of Lisp that required its implementations to use tail call optimization, placing a strong emphasis on functional programming and recursive algorithms, in particular. The Scheme programming language employs a design philosophy of minimalism, specifying a small standard core and providing powerful tools for extending the language. It is widely used in educational and scientific organizations, especially in the field of AI. Programmers who write in Scheme are informally known as 'Schemers.' Similarities to Lisp The syntax of the Scheme is very similar to Lisp. It is based on s-expressions: parenthesized lists in which the operator comes first and the operands follow. For instance, the expression '3 plus 4 times 5' is written in Scheme as (+ 3 (* 4 5)). Like Lisp, Scheme uses the lambda keyword to represent anonymous functions. For instance, the statement (lambda (x y) (+ x y)) represents an anonymous function that adds two numbers. Other notable features Lexical scope — the bindings of all variables in Scheme are determined by the unit of code in which the variable appears. A shared namespace for variables and procedures — the same primitives used to operate on variables can be used to operate on procedures and functions as well. A full set of numerical data types. Delayed evaluation, which allows for the implementation of asynchronous programming techniques such as promises and futures. Hygenic macros — a macro system that allows the programmer to extend the functionality of the language without interfering with the language's native syntax. The ability to natively evaluate its own code. The ability to redefine standard procedures and functions. Hello, World! in Scheme (display 'Hello, World!')

In typography, a section is a distinct area of a document that is separated from other areas of the same object. A good example of a section is a chapter, usually distinguished by a title page. Sections may be marked by a solid or dotted line, highlighting, or some other means. 2. When referring to HTML, a section is an area in the web page containing specific programming, text, or images that are separated from other areas by using certain HTML tags. Common tags used to create sections in a web page are <div>, <frameset> and <section>. All web pages also have a <header> and <body> tag, which can be considered sections as well. Div, HTML tag, Programming terms, Section break, Source code Seed A seed may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to computer programming, security, or software a random seed is a number or other value that is generated by software using one or more values. For example, hardware information, time, or date are different examples of values that can be used to help generate a random value used by a program or encryption. 2. With BitTorrent, a seed is client on BitTorrent that is only sharing a complete file. 3. When talking about data and machine learning, seed data is a collection of information that is used as training, testing, or as a template. For example, out computer dictionary terms could be used as seed data for anyone interested in writing their own version of a computer dictionary or who needed ideas of computer terms. Programming terms, Random, Security terms Segfault A segfault, also known as a segmentation fault or access violation, is a computer error that occurs when a piece of software attempts to access a portion of memory incorrectly. The error is raised by the MMU, a hardware component (usually located on the CPU) that manages all memory access instructions in the computer. A segfault may occur, for instance, if improperly written software attempts to write data to a read-only portion of memory, or if it attempts to dereference a null pointer. The name 'segmentation fault' originated in the 1950s, and it refers to the fact that only the data segment of a program's allocated memory is writable, while the code segment is not. Error, Memory, Programming terms, Segmentation Separator A separator may refer to any of the following: 1. A line that helps divide and break up icons from other icons or text. For example, a menu separator helps break up sections of a menu. See the menu definition for a visual representation. 2. A separator is another word used to describe a delimiter. Divider, Operating system terms, Programming terms Sequence A sequence may refer to any of the following: 1. A sequence is an ordered list containing successive steps or functions for performing certain actions. It can be used in programming or as a simple set of instructions to achieve a result, like accessing an account on a website or creating a word processing document. 2. In an SQL database, a sequence is used to generate a unique number and starting point, which is then increased based on a set interval. A sequence is often used to create a primary key value in a database table, and is incremented by one with each newly generated database entry. 3. Upon startup, computers utilize what is called a boot sequence. See our boot sequence for further information on this term. Database terms, Programming terms Server-side scripting Server-side scripting is a method of designing websites so that the process or user request is run on the originating server. Server-side scripts provide an interface to the user and are used to limit access to proprietary data and help keep control of the script source code. Below is an example of client-side scripts vs. server-side scripts. Server-side scripting examples Many languages may be used to create these scripts. They include but are not limited to the examples below. ActiveVFP ASP C DC Java JavaScript (using SSJS (Server-side JavaScript) e.g., node.js) Perl PHP Python R Ruby Internet terms, Programming terms, Script, Server, Server-side, Web design terms Server-side When functions, procedures, calculations, or other processing methods are performed on a server, they are considered server-side. By contrast, client-side is on the user's end. A good example of a script that executes on the server-side is a shopping cart or a search engine. Some of the programming languages are designed for server-side processing are ASP, PHP, and Perl. See our server-side scripting definition for a full list and additional information. Today, almost all websites and online applications utilize both server-side client-side processing. Note Server-side processing is generally slower than client-side, so programmers prefer utilizing client-side programming whenever possible. Internet terms, JavaScript, Programming terms, Server-side scripting Servlet Short for Java Servlet, a servlet is a Java applet that runs on a server to help handle network requests. If Java is running on the server, servlets can be used in place of scripts. They may be used to handle form submissions, perform calculations, or do other tasks that need to be performed server-side. Computer abbreviations, Java, Programming terms SGML Short for standard generalized markup language, SGML is an ISO standard that offers a general definition of a markup language. It lays out rules for what type of markup is valid, and how that markup should be parsed. Not all markup languages conform to the SGML standard. For instance, HTML5 is not compatible with SGML. Complete details of the standard may be viewed at https://www.iso.org/standard/16387.html. Computer acronyms, Markup, Programming terms Shebang Slang often used in computer Perl programming and other script files. The term shebang refers to the '#!' located at the top of many script files that points to the path of the associated program. For example, in a Perl script, the complete line may look like the following: #!/usr/local/bin/perl This line instructs the operating system running the Perl script on where the executable for Perl and its associated files are located. This line is commonly only required in Linux and Unix variants, users running Perl in Microsoft Windows do not need this line. Bang, Perl, Programming terms Shell A shell is a software interface that's often a command line interface that enables the user to interact with the computer. Some examples of shells are MS-DOS Shell (command.com), csh, ksh, PowerShell, sh, and tcsh. Below is a picture and example of what a Terminal window with an open shell. Bourne shell, Jailed shell, Korn shell, Operating system terms, Programming terms, Script Shift Shift may refer to any of the following: 1. Shift is the name of a computer keyboard key. See our Shift key page for full information about this key. 2. Shift is a Microsoft command line command that changes the position of replaceable parameters in a batch program. Additional information about this command is found on our shift command page. 3. When referring to a Linux shell, shift is a builtin command of the Bash shell that shifts the values of command-line arguments for processing in a script. See our bash shift command page for further information. 4. In some programming languages shift is a function that removes the first element of an array. For example, in the Perl code below shift removes 'one' from the beginning of the array to make it 'two three'. my @example = ('one', 'two', 'three'); shift @example; print '@example'; #Prints: two three Tip If you want to add to the end of an array, use the push function. If you want to remove the first element of the array, use the shift function. Operating system terms, Programming terms Short-circuit operator A short-circuit operator is used in some programming languages to execute a second argument when the outcome of the first statement is not sufficient to evaluate the full expression. It provides users developing the program with more control over how expressions and arguments are processed. A standard expression may say if x is true, then the entire expression is true. However, where the generalization for one argument outcome may not be enough, a short-circuit operator may be used. An example is if x then y else false. The short-circuit operator allows the program to evaluate the first argument, along with any side effects of that argument, and then move on to evaluate the second argument, if necessary. Programming terms Signedness In computer science, the signedness of a data type indicates whether or not a variable of that type can be a negative number. Specifically: If a numeric variable is 'unsigned,' it can represent only a positive number or zero. If a numeric variable is 'signed,' it can also represent a negative number because one of the bits of data is dedicated to representing 'positive' or 'negative'. For instance, a signed eight-bit numeric type can represent the numbers -127 through 127. Seven of the bits are used for the binary representation of zero (0000000) through 127 (1111111), and one of the bits represents whether the number is positive or negative. By contrast, an unsigned eight-bit type may represent the numbers 0 (00000000) through 255 (11111111). Data type, Programming terms Simulated annealing Simulated annealing, also known as SA, is a technique used to optimize complex search algorithms. It is used to find the algorithms that have the best chance of performing well, even though they may not be the guaranteed best solution. SA is used in many computer science and mathematical optimizations. A good use for SA would be for the travelling salesman finding the best path between interconnected cities. SA is helpful for salesman because the search space of possible solutions grows exponentially as the size of the problem increases. The term originates from metallurgy, in which annealing is the controlled heating and cooling of metals to reduce their defects gradually. In SA, this process is simulated by gradually reducing the probability of sub-optimal solutions as a search space grows larger. Computer Science, Programming terms Single step A single step is when a program is executed one step at a time. Usually, to locate a flaw or error that is causing the program not to operate properly. Debugging, Programming terms Smalltalk Developed by Alan Kay and other researchers at Xerox PARC in 1972, Smalltalk is the second object-oriented programming language and the first true IDE (integrated development environment).

Object-oriented, Programming terms SMIL Short for Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language, SMIL is an XML (extensible markup language) that describes multimedia events and objects. It was proposed in 1999 by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and can be used to define the appearance and animated characteristics of many different forms of audio and visual digital media. As a markup language, SMIL has many similarities to HTML. Its main body of content is contained in a section, for instance. SMIL is used in the interface of many DVD players, and is used by Hulu as part of its video-on-demand interface. Software that supports SMIL includes QuickTime and RealPlayer. Note SMIL files have the extension .smi or .smil. Computer acronyms, Markup language, Multimedia, Programming terms, XML Snippet Alternatively referred to as a code snippet, a snippet is a small portion of text that is part of a larger set of programming code used for applications and web pages. Snippets are designed to be re-useable and add functionality, such as linking different areas of a program together. Snippets are available in virtually all programming languages, including PHP, CGI, Java, JavaScript, Visual Basic, C++, and more. Many snippets are free to use, but can include personal use restrictions. Other snippets may require a one-time or recurring license fee to use.

Computer acronyms, Programming terms, Protocol, XML Socket A socket may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to a processor, a CPU socket or processor socket is a connection that allows a computer processor to be connected to a motherboard. For example, the Socket 370 is an example of such a socket. The picture shows an example of what a socket may look like on a motherboard. Although there have been computers that used the slot processor, most computers today and in the past have used socket processors. Computer processor sockets Below is a short list of sockets and their description we currently have listed on our page. Why would I need to know the socket on my motherboard? The processor socket helps determine what computer processors your computer motherboard is capable of accepting. For example, a socket 1 processor is not compatible with a Socket 370 because of the pin layout and the technology differences used in each socket. 2. When referring to an operating system, a socket is a communication used between processes or communication between a client and server. One of the most widely used socket API or library is the Berkeley Unix C library. 3. With networking, see our network socket definition for further information on this term. CPU terms, LIF socket, Motherboard terms, Power socket, Programming terms, Slotket, Socks, ZIF socket Soft With computers soft is a term used to describe something that is capable of being changed or modified easily. The term software is a non-physical component of your computer that is easy to change. For instance, individual programs can be installed and uninstalled without much difficulty. In contrast, hardware is a physical component of the computer, which can only be changed by powering the computer off and physically removing it. Programming terms, Soft error Software development process Alternatively referred to as software life cycle and software development phases, the software development process is a set of steps that a software program goes through when developed. The illustration shows a waterfall type approach to software development and an example of the steps taken in the phases of software development. Overview of the software development process First in the software development process, the requirements phase outlines the goals of what the program will be capable of doing. Next, the design phase covers how the program is going to be created, who will be doing what, etc. The implementation phase is where programmers and other designers start work on the program. After the developers have a working copy, the testing (alpha and beta testing) and verification step can begin to help verify the program has no errors. During the testing phase, problems found are fixed, until the program meets the company's quality controls. After the program's development, the documentation phase on how to use the program can be completed. Finally, maintaining (updating) the program must continue for several years after the initial release until its EOL (end-of-life). A software development process makes everything easier and reduces the amount of problems encountered. Some companies and government agencies require a software development process or that you adhere to the ISO 12207, which defines a life cycle of software. Life cycle, Programming terms, Revision control Software engineering Software engineering is the programming and production that goes into the software development process. Software engineering commonly involves the planning, design, and continued development and maintenance of a software application. How do I become a software engineer? To become a software engineer requires a solid understanding of computer programming. Ideally, when learning a programming language, you would want to learn the language that the company is using. However, learning most programming languages give you many of the programming fundamentals required for most languages. Programming terms, Software Software library A software library may refer to any of the following: 1. When talking about a program or programming, a software library refers to a collection of files, programs, routines, scripts, or functions that can be referenced in the programming code. 2. A software library is a collection of software owned by a single company. Library, Programming terms, Software Source Source may refer to any of the following: 1. In general, a source is the location from which information is gathered. For example, if you were copying information from a CD to a computer the CD is considered the source and the computer is the destination. 2. When referring to computer programming or a software program, source or source code refers to the code used to create the program. See our code definition for full information on this term and related links. 3. With hardware, the source is a part of a transistor where an electrical current flows when the transistor is closed. 4. When referring to a website, the source or HTML source code is the HTML or other code used to generate a web page on a browser. Any code that is not server-side can be viewed by anyone who visits your site. Note The source code for server-side scripts written in languages like Perl and PHP cannot be viewed. When you look at the source of a script, you are only able to see the HTML generated by the script, not the script itself. 5. Source can also be abbreviated as src, and is an attribute used with many HTML tags. The following example shows it in use with the <img> element. <img src='https://www.computerhope.com/logo.gif'> 6. When referring to an HTML tag, the <source> tag is used to designate additional media resources for the <video> and <audio> elements. 7. In the bash shell, the source builtin command loads and executes a shell configuration file. For more information, see our source bash builtin command reference. Computer abbreviations, Destination, Electronics terms, Program listing, Programming terms SourceForge The world's largest open-source software development website, hosting over 100,000 different projects. SourceForge is a great site for developers to host and manage their open source projects for free. Related pages The official SourceForge website is https://sourceforge.net/. Open-source, Programming terms, Software terms Source computer Alternatively referred to as a build computer, a source computer is a computer designated to assemble or generate a program from code. This computer is commonly a separate computer on a network because of the length of time required to build a program or because multiple people may be working on the same program. Programming terms, Source Source data In computer programming, source data or data source is the primary location from where data comes. The data source can be a database, a dataset, a spreadsheet or even hard-coded data. When data is displayed in a web page or application, in a column-row format or other formats, the data is retrieved from its data source and presented in the format defined in the code. Computer applications can have multiple data sources defined, depending on its function. Applications like Oracle, SalesForce.com, and SAP all use databases as data sources. A common type of database is an SQL database, but some applications can use other types of databases, like Microsoft Access. While less stable, a series of spreadsheets can be used as a data source, but this is less common due to the chance of spreadsheets becoming corrupted as their size increases. Databases are often part of a larger data backup system and can be maintained more efficiently, thus making them more popular choices as data sources. Data, Programming terms, Source Spaghetti code Spaghetti code is slang used to describe a program's source code that is difficult to read or follow by a human because of how the original programmer wrote the code. Below are some examples of what can cause spaghetti code. Spaghetti code examples Code is not organized and has portions of code that belongs elsewhere in the code. Code jumps around to other portions or files a lot making it harder to debug without also having to jump around a lot. Code contains goto statements that the programmer has to follow to an entirely new area of code. Code is not broken into conditional blocks or tabbed making it difficult to read. Spaghetti code is considered bad practice because if errors are experienced, it is more difficult to locate what is causing the error. Spaghetti code can be reduced by keeping your code organized, formatted properly, commenting, using subroutines, and if possible breaking your code into sections. Kludge, Obfuscation, Programming terms Sparse matrix A sparse matrix is a one in which the majority of the values are zero. The proportion of zero elements to non-zero elements is called the sparsity of the matrix. The opposite of a sparse matrix, in which the majority of its values are non-zero, is called a dense matrix. Sparse matrices are used by scientists and engineers when solving partial differential equations. For example, a measurement of a matrix's sparsity can be useful when developing theories about the connectivity of computer networks. When using large sparse matrices in a computer program, it is important to optimize the data structures and algorithms to take advantage of the fact that most of the values will be zero. Sparse matrix example Here is an example of a 4 x 4 matrix containing 12 zero values and 4 non-zero values, giving it a sparsity of 3: [[5, 0, 0, 0 , [0, 11, 0, 0 , [0, 0, 25, 0 , [0, 0, 0, 7   Matrix, Programming terms, Zero Special purpose language A special purpose language is a program language that was designed for a specific function.

Computer acronyms, Programming language, Programming terms Spooling Spooling may refer to any of the following: 1. See the print spooler definition for further information about printer spooling. 2. In computer programming, spooling refers to placing data into an intermediate storage area, where it is held until the computer (or the user) is ready to process it. This storage area is called a spool. Most computers have print spools, for example, which hold printing jobs that are waiting to be printed. Additionally, computers which process e-mail will often have mail spools for each user which functions as their mailbox. E-mail is stored in the mail spool until the user decides to archive or delete it. Buffer, Printing terms, Programming terms SQL Short for Structured Query Language, SQL, originally known as SEQUEL (structured English query language), was developed by Dr. Edgar F. Codd at the IBM research center in 1974. Later shortened to SQL, but still pronounced as sequel, SQL has become the de facto standard database language. The first commercial version of SQL was introduced in 1979 by Oracle. Today, there are three standards: SQL89 (SQL1), SQL92 (SQL2), and SQL99 (SQL3). Related pages Programming language history. Computer acronyms, Database, Database terms, DDL, DML, MySQL, Oracle database, Primary key, RDBMS, SQL injection, SQL Server, Synonym Stack A stack may refer to any of the following: 1. A stack is a collection of software components that are designed (and often required) to operate together as a single unit. For example, the collection of libraries and protocols that enables TCP/IP networking is frequently referred to as the 'TCP/IP stack.' Similarly, a developer who is proficient with all the components of web application development is referred to as a full stack developer. 2. In computer programming, a stack is a data structure that only operates on the most recent item added, also known as LIFO (last-in, first-out). When a new item is added to the stack, it's called 'pushing' that item onto the stack. When the most recent data item is retrieved and removed from the structure, it's called 'popping' the item from the stack. These 'push' and 'pop' operations may also apply to an array, if the item added, or retrieved and then removed, is at the end of the array. 3. A stack may also refer to a collection of computers that are stacked upon each other or a series of caseless computer components a computer farm. 4. In some video games, multiple players join to defeat a creature, creating a party or raid. When fighting some creatures, it is necessary to stack together. When players stack, they are moving to a common spot, standing in a tight group to create a smaller target for the creature to hit or share incoming damage. 5. Stacks are a collection of folders found on the far right side of the Apple dock. The three default stacks are Applications, Documents, and Downloads. Game terms, Heap, Network terms, Programming terms, Stack pointer, Stack puke Stack pointer Often used in computer programming, the stack pointer refers to a cutoff point for relevance in a stack of memory. This point is the smallest address, anything smaller is seen as garbage and higher, valid data.

It is a file descriptor in Unix-like operating systems, and programming languages such as C, Perl, and Java. Below, is an example of how STDIN could be used in Perl. print 'Type something: '; my $example = <STDIN>; print ' You typed: $example '; In the example above, when ran the script would ask you to type something. Whatever is typed is saved in the $example variable and then printed as 'You typed: xxxx,' where xxxx is what is saved in the variable. Computer abbreviations, Input, Programming terms, Stdout Stream processing Stream processing is a model for processing an ongoing stream of data. It differs from traditional programming models, in which a set of data is loaded from a disk into memory and then processed in arbitrary ways. In stream processing, a small number of predefined operations are performed progressively in parallel as data becomes available in the stream. Stream processing is well-suited to DSP (digital signal processing), computer vision, digital video and image processing, and big data analysis. It enables a business to process, analyze, and draw conclusions from data as it's being collected in real-time.

Analysis, Cloud, Computing, Programming terms Strongly typed language A programming language that requires a variable to be defined as well as the variable it is. For example, C is a strongly typed language, when declaring the variable you must also specify the variable type. In the following example, the test variable is declared as an integer in the first line, the second line as a floating point, and the third line or character. int test = 25; float test = 2.3; char test = 'e'; The opposite of a strongly typed language is a loosely typed language, such as Perl.

Abbreviated as sub, subscript is character(s) that are half the height of a standard character and printed lower than the rest of the text. Below is an example of subscript text, which shows 'Subscript Text' half way below the bottom line of the 'Normal Text.' Normal Text Subscript Text Creating subscript in Microsoft Word To create subscript in Microsoft Word, highlight the text you want to subscript and then click the subscript button, which is the X 2 in the Font section. Tip You can also highlight the text you want to subscript and press and hold down the Ctrl key and press the = on the top row of your keyboard. Creating subscript in HTML To subscript text in HTML, use the <sub></sub> tags as shown in the example below. Normal Text <sub>Subscript Text</sub> Why would anyone need to use subscript? Besides using subscript for its visual properties, there are other places that it can be used. Listing how many atoms are in a chemical formula. For example, with water 'H 2 O' indicates there are two H atoms and one O atom. O' indicates there are two H atoms and one O atom. In mathematics, a subscript can be used to describe different versions of the same variable or used to refer to a member of sequence or set. 2. In computer programming, a subscript is a number that represents an element in an array example[3  or $example[3  the '[3 ' is the subscript of the 'example' array.

Related pages The official Subversion website is https://subversion.apache.org. CVS, Open-source, Programming terms, Revision control Superclass In object-oriented programming, a class from which other classes inherit code is called a superclass, and the class that inherits the code is called a subclass of that superclass. Typically, a subclass inherits the instance variables and member functions of its superclass. Object-oriented programming, Programming terms, Variable Switch statement In programming, the switch statement is a conditional block used as a method of shortening a long set of if else statements. For example, consider the below if else blocks (using PHP), in the example below. if ($num == 0)   echo 'The number is zero!';   elseif ($num == 1)   echo 'The number is one!';   elseif ($num == 2)   echo 'The number is two!';   else   echo 'Error!';   Rather than writing several if else blocks to run statements based on the value of one variable, you can use the switch statement to perform the task with fewer blocks of code. Let's take a look at the following code example. switch ($num)   case 0 : echo 'The number is zero!'; break; case 1 : echo 'The number is one!'; break; case 2 : echo 'The number is two!'; break; default : echo 'Error!';   With the switch statement, the variable name is used once in the opening line. A case keyword is used to provide the possible values of the variable, which is followed by a colon and a set of statements to run if the variable is equal to a corresponding value. The keyword default is used to handle any values that are not covered with one of the cases (like an ending else statement). Programming terms Syntactic sugar Syntactic sugar is any aspect of the syntax of a programming language that makes programs easier to read, write, or understand. The term was coined by computer scientist Peter Landin in 1964 to describe a hypothetical language that eloquently expresses lambda calculus operations. Specifically, the language would replace the lambda symbol 'λ' with the word 'where'. A common example of syntactic sugar is an augmented assignment operator such as += which simplifies the expression x = x + y to the compound operation x += y. Operator, Programming terms, Syntax Syntax When referring to a programming language, syntax is a set of rules for grammar and spelling. In other words, it means using character structures that a computer can interpret. For example, if a user tries to execute a command without proper syntax, it generates syntax error, usually causing the program to fail. In a text editor that supports syntax highlighting, the programming language's syntax elements (keywords, variable names, operators, etc.) are colored, making it easier to read the code. Argument, Command, Programming terms System development System development is the overall process of designing, building or programming, and completing a product. This process applies to the development of a computer, hardware device, or software program. Software terms Systems engineer A systems engineer is a person who designs and manages complex systems over their entire life cycle. Systems engineering is a discipline that spans many different industries including aircraft design, software engineering, CPU design, and the construction of a skyscraper. A systems engineer manages all the issues a complex project encounters, such as logistics, resource management, optimization methods, and risk management. Related pages What jobs are available in the computer industry? Programming terms Tail recursion In computer programming, tail recursion is the use of a tail call to perform a recursive function. A tail call is when a function is called as the last act of another function. For instance, in this JavaScript program: var myTailFunc = function (myVar)   return myVar;  ; var myFunc = function (myVar)   return myTailFunc(myVar);  ; Here, the call to myTailFunc(myVar) is a tail call because it is the last operation of myFunc(myVar). When the compiler sees that it is the final operation of myFunc, it can perform a small optimization. Essentially, it does not need to push a return address onto the stack, because it will not need to return to myFunc. It can return the return value of myTailFunc as the return value of myFunc. This small optimization becomes more significant when used in a recursive function. Normally, each level of recursion would require an additional return address to be pushed onto the stack. Tail recursion makes this unnecessary. Here is an example of a simple JavaScript factorial function written first without, and then with, tail recursion. Factorial function without tail recursion var factorial = function (n)   if (n == 0)   return 1;   else   return n * factorial (n - 1);    ; This function is recursive, but not tail recursive. The final process of the function is the multiplication operation ('*'), so the recursion will always need to return to the calling function. Factorial function with tail recursion var factorial = function (n)   var recursion = function (n, subTotal)   if (n == 0)   return subTotal;   else   return recursion(n - 1, n * subTotal);    ; return recursion(n, 1);  ; Function, Programming terms Tcl Originally short for Tool command language, Tcl is no longer an acronym and is an open source scripting language that was developed by John Ousterhout. Tcl is available for different platforms and used to create useful software programs for almost any need. Below is an example of printing 'Hello World!' in Tcl. puts 'Hello World!'

Expect, Perl, Programming language, Programming terms, Tk Theoretical computer science Theoretical computer science is a division of computer science which focuses on the abstract, mathematical aspects of computing. It includes the study of: Informally, theoretical computer science was born in 1936 when Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, and Stephen Kleene formally defined algorithms is in terms of computation. In the present day, it deals heavily with quantum computers, which perform mathematical computations on the wavefunction of a particle. Computer Science, Programming terms Ternary operator The ternary operator is an operator that exists in some programming languages, which takes three operands rather than the typical one or two that most operators use. It provides a way to shorten a simple if else block. For example, consider the below JavaScript code. var num = 4, msg = ''; if (num === 4)   msg = 'Correct!';   else   msg = 'Incorrect!';   alert(msg); If the num variable is equal to 4, then the user will get a 'Correct!' message. Otherwise, the user receives an 'Incorrect!' message. With this type of comparison, you can shorten the code using the ternary operator. Below is an example of how it works. variable_name = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if false; A ternary operator allows you to assign one value to the variable if the condition is true, and another value if the condition is false. The if else block example from above could now be written as shown in the example below. var num = 4, msg = ''; msg = (num === 4) ? 'Correct!' : 'Incorrect!'; alert(msg); In many cases, this can make the assignment of a value to a variable easier to see, because it is contained on a single line instead of an if else block. Operator, Programming terms Third-generation programming language A third-generation programming language (3GL), is a programming language that is machine-independent. Programs written in a 3GL can be compiled to run on many different devices. Compare this to a first-generation programming language (machine code), or a second-generation programming language (assembly language). In those languages, the program is written specifically for a certain type of CPU and instruction set. 3GLs first appeared in the 1950s with the development of FORTRAN, ALGOL, and COBOL. These languages are considered 'high-level,' even though they are a much lower-level than modern high-level programming languages such as C++, Ruby, and JavaScript. Programming terms Thread A thread may refer to any of the following: 1. With respect to computer programming, a thread is a small set of instructions designed to be scheduled and executed by the CPU independently of the parent process. For example, a program may have an open thread waiting for a specific event to occur or running a separate job, allowing the main program to perform other tasks. A program is capable of having multiple threads open at once and will either terminate or suspend them after a task is completed, or the program is closed. A multithreading CPU is capable of executing multiple threads concurrently. Hyper-Threading, an Intel technology, divides a physical core of a CPU into two logical cores, executing an additional, concurrent set of instructions to increase performance. 2. When referring to a computer forum, a thread consists of an original message or post and each of its corresponding responses. For example, in a newsgroup or message board, a user may post a question relating to computers; each of the replies relating to the original message are a single thread. Below is an illustration to help give you a better idea of how a thread looks. Original Post: <Original Message> user - [email protected  Hello, I was wondering if anyone knows how to turn on a computer. >>Joe - [email protected  >>User have you tried pressing the power button? >>>>User - [email protected  >>>>Joe what is the power button? >>>>>>Joe - [email protected  >>>>>>The power button is usually a small round button located on the front of your computer's case. As can be seen by the above example thread, a user can view the complete message and make any additional feedback or comments as well. A thread can refer to any ongoing communication, including e-mail. Background, Background thread, Fork, Forum, Internet terms, Message, Message board, Newsgroup, Programming terms, TLP Thunk Thunk may refer to any of the following: 1. When referring to ALGOL, a thunk was developed by Peter Ingerman in 1961 and is a function with no parameters that returns an address for a parameter. 2. A thunk is a stubroutine in an overlay programming environment that loads and jumps to the correct overlay. 3. Term sometimes used by users to describe a loud noise. For example, the computer hard drive made a loud thunk and stopped working. Related pages Noise from computer. Programming terms Tk Tk may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for toolkit, Tk is a library of GUI elements that was developed by John Ousterhout, and included with Tcl to help promote and allow for the development of a GUI interface. Today, other languages such as Perl include their own Tk, which is in part or all of the Tcl/Tk libraries. Related pages Complete information about Tcl/Tk is available at http://www.tcl.tk. 2. .tk is also a domain suffix for Tokelau. Computer abbreviations, Perl, Programming terms, Tcl Token A token may refer to any of the following: 1. A portion of data that is passed from computer to computer in token ring networks. When a computer has a token, it is capable of communicating to other computers and devices on the network. Related pages Computer network and network card help and support. 2. When referring to programming or batch files, a token often refers to a portion of a much larger piece of data. For example, the date: 12/06/2016 could be broken into tokens: 12, 06, and 2016. Once these tokens have been gathered, the programmer may use only the portions they want. In the case of the date example, they could use only the day and not the month or year. 3. A security token is a physical device that can usually fit on a keyring, which generates a security code for use with networks or software applications. Network terms, Programming terms, Variable Toolbox A toolbox may refer to any of the following: 1. A toolbox is a window or pane that contains icons and buttons that are tools in the program. The tools are for quick access to common operations. A toolbox may float freely or be docked in the main window of the program. For example, Microsoft Paint contains a toolbox including the pencil, eraser, and others. Tip Many programs that have a toolbox allow the users to display or hide it through the View drop-down menu at the top of the window. 2.

Button, Drop-down menu, Icon, Programming terms, Software terms Transcompiler A transcompiler, also known as a source-to-source compiler or transpiler, is a special type of compiler that converts the source code of a program into another language. It can also be used to process a program written in an older version of a programming language, and convert it to a newer version of the same language. Additional transcompiler information Many programming languages begin as transcompiled languages. For example, the earliest versions of C++ did not have a native compiler. Instead, C++ programs were transcompiled to the C programming language, and then changed over to binary using existing C compilers. Another use of transcompilation is to convert code that has already been compiled into the source code of another language. One example of this is Emscripten, a transcompiler which converts C and C++ programs compiled with LLVM into JavaScript. Programming terms True In programming, true is a Boolean value that is used when the result of a logical statement is true (as opposed to false). For example, you may want to check whether two values are equal and run one block of code when this is true and a different block of code if this is not true. Below, is an example of some JavaScript code as an example. var x = 2; var y = 2; if (x === y)   window.alert('x equal to y is true');   else   window.alert('x equal to y is not true');   In this code, if x is equal to y, the user receives an alert that says 'x equal to y is true'. Otherwise, the user receives an alert that says 'x equal to y is false'. Boolean, False, Programming terms True BASIC True BASIC is a version of the programming language BASIC written by the authors of BASIC, John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz, in 1983. Their purpose was to update the BASIC language in response to criticism it received. True BASIC is a compiled, structured language, does not require line numbers, and includes the advanced control structures necessary for structured programming. BASIC, Programming terms Trunk A trunk may refer to any of the following: 1. With data communication, a trunk is a data line with large bandwidth capabilities that connects two locations. Related pages Computer network and network card help and support. 2. With revision control or versions, a trunk is the main version of a project. Any experimental or special versions are considered branches. Backbone, Network terms, Programming terms Tuple A tuple is used in various programming languages as an ordered list of elements and referenced as a n-tuple, where 'n' is the number of elements in an ordered list. Most often, a tuple is represented by including the elements in parentheses, but a tuple may also use brackets or curly brackets. For example, '(5, 9, 11, 3, 22, 14)' would be a 6-tuple, as it has six elements in the ordered list. Ordered list, Parentheses, Programming terms Turbo Pascal First released in 1983, Turbo Pascal is a comprehensive software development system for the Pascal programming language. It was developed by Borland, and it ran on the CP/M, PC-DOS, and MS-DOS operating systems. Turbo Pascal was the first software development package to include the editor, compiler, and linker All-in-One application. Turbo Pascal was extremely successful, and subsequent versions also included enhancements for the language itself, making it a unique programming language in its own right. For instance, versions 5.5 and later of Turbo Pascal supported object-oriented programming. Operating system, Pascal, Programming terms, Software development Turing completeness In computer science, Turing completeness is a classification for a system of rules that manipulate data. It is named after computer scientist Alan Turing, inventor of the Turing machine. For instance, programming languages and CPU instruction sets are examples of formal rule systems that access and modify data. If the rules can be used to simulate Turing's hypothetical computing machine, the rules are said to be 'Turing complete.' A Turing-complete system can be proven mathematically to be capable of performing any possible calculation or computer program. An example of a Turing complete system is lambda calculus that was developed by Alonzo Church, Alan Turing's professor. Examples of Turing complete systems Computer Science, Lambda calculus, Programming terms Unary operator In computer programming, a unary operator is an operator that takes only one value for its operation. An example in the C programming language is the increment operator (++), which increments a given value by 1. For instance, to increment the variable x by 1, you could express this as: x++ We only needed one value (x) in this statement. Compare this to using the addition operator (+): x + 1 This operation required two values (x and 1) and is an example of a binary operation. Operator, Programming terms, Value Undefined Anything that lacks a description or is not declared is considered undefined. For example, in computer programming, if a variable is not declared when the program or script is run, you will receive a 'no value,' 'not defined,' 'unbound,' 'undefined' error message. use strict; $x = 'Example'; print '$x '; In the example above of a Perl script, because 'use strict;' is used in the script, all variables must be declared. Because the $x variable is not declared in the example above, this script would give an error. use strict; my $x = 'Example'; print '$x '; In the example above, the $x variable is declared by adding 'my' in front of the line. Since the variable is now declared and defined, this script prints 'Example.' NaN, Null, Programming terms, Undefined variable Undefined variable An undefined variable is a variable that is used in a program that has not been previously declared in the source code. In most programming languages, this results in an error. For example, in JavaScript a variable must be declared using the var keyword. If not, trying to assign a value to the variable will result in an error: X = 1; // causes an error To fix this, the variable can be defined and then assigned the value: Var x; x = 1; // no error In the case of JavaScript, 'undefined' is also a special value that is used for any variable declared with the var keyword but has not yet been assigned a value. To immediately assign a value to a variable, add the assignment to the declaration statement: Var x = 1; // variable declared and assigned a value With this in place, the x variable won't have a value of 'undefined'. Declaration, JavaScript, Programming terms, Undefined, Variable Underflow An underflow is a condition or exception that is generated when a calculation or computer operation results in a number that is smaller than what is capable of being shown. Error, Overflow, Programming terms, Zero Unescape The unescape function is used in JavaScript to decode a string encoded using the encode function, or to decode other types of encoded strings (such as URLs). For example, the JavaScript below will encode and then decode a string. var jif = 'JavaScript is fun!'; var esc_jif = escape(jif); document.write(esc_jif + '<br /><br />'); var unesc_jif = unescape(esc_jif); document.write(unesc_jif); This displays the results shown below. JavaScript%20is%20fun%21 JavaScript is fun! Tip It should be noted, however, that the escape and unescape functions are not encouraged for future use in JavaScript. Instead, it is recommended to use the encodeURI or decodeURI functions. Escape, Function, Programming terms Unit test A unit test is performed on sections of code in computer programs to make sure they are functioning properly. Programming terms, Test Unshift In some programming languages unshift is a function that adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array. For example, in the Perl code below unshift adds 'zero' to the beginning of the array to make it 'zero one two three'. my @example = ('one', 'two', 'three'); unshift @example, 'zero'; print '@example '; #Prints: zero one two three Tip If you want to add to the end of an array, use the push function. If you want to remove the first element of the array, use the shift function. Programming terms Value A value may refer to any of the following: 1. In mathematics and computer programming, a value is a definite object that may be stored in a variable. The value can be numeric (such as an integer, or a floating point number), or alphanumeric (such as a character, or a string). It may also contain special characters like a dollar sign ($) or pound sign (#). A value can be used for multiple purposes, including calculating a mathematical formula, creating pictures or music, or for displaying the value on a web page or Word document. $firstvar = 13; $secondvar = 48; $total = $firstvar + $secondvar; print 'The total value is: $total '; In the program example above, there are three variables: 'firstvar' that has a value of '13,' 'secondvar' that has a value of '48,' and the 'total' variable that takes the value of both variables to get a value of '61'. When this program is run, it will print 'The total value is: 61' to the screen. 2. The term value also applies to HTML and CSS. With HTML, an attribute value dictates the setting for an attribute. Likewise, a value does the same for a CSS property. Accuracy, Object, Programming terms VAR A var may refer to any of the following: 1. Var is an abbreviation for the word variable. 2. Short for value-added reseller, VAR is a company that sells computer systems to end-users and small companies. Value-added resellers often have the capability of configuring the system with specific hardware or software to meet the customer's needs. 3. When referring to HTML, the <var> tag is used to designate that a section of text is a variable. Business terms, Computer acronyms, OEM, Programming terms, Tag Variable A variable may refer to any of the following: 1. A variable is a value or option that changes over time or based on user input. 2. With programming, a variable is a location capable of storing temporary data within a program. This data can then be modified, stored, or displayed whenever needed. For example, a program may have a variable named '$myvariable' with a value of 0 or null, and when a user enters data, the variable uses the inputted data as variable value. Example of a variable Below is an example of a variable in the Perl programming language. my $myvariable = 'Computer Hope'; print 'There is hope, $myvariable'; In the above example, the $myvariable is declared using 'my' and has an expression (value) of 'Computer Hope,' that is used on the next line to print 'There is hope, Computer Hope' to the screen. What is a private variable? In most programming languages, a private variable is a variable declared in a class that cannot be accessed outside of that class or outside the enclosing code block. %1, Captured variable, Constant, Dependent variable, Environment variable, Literal, Programming terms Visual Basic VB or Visual Basic is a programming language developed by Microsoft with the help of Alan Cooper, and was first released in May 1991. Visual Basic was designed with the beginner programmer in mind and for programmers who needed to develop visual elements in their programs. In Visual Basic, users can drag and reposition visual elements like windows, buttons, and forms and then create events and triggers for those elements. Since its release, there were a total of six different versions of Visual Basic released (1.0, 1.0 for MS-DOS, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0). The last version of Visual Basic, version 6.0 was released in 1998. After Visual Basic 6.0, Microsoft moved Visual Basic to the .NET Framework. From then on, Visual Basic was known as Visual Basic .NET. It is sometimes also referred to as Visual Basic 7.0 and Visual Basic 2002 (year of its release). Since moving to the .NET framework, there have been six versions of Visual Basic .NET released. These versions are: Visual Basic .NET, Visual Basic .NET 2003, Visual Basic 2005, Visual Basic 2008, Visual Basic 2010, and Visual Basic 2012. BASIC, C#, Computer acronyms, .NET, Programming terms Vector A vector may refer to any of the following: 1.

In computer terms, a void can refer to a data type or object used in computer programming that does not have a return a value or type. It may or may not perform a function, other than storing a value for other processes to use. 2. Void can also apply to the termination of warranty due to violation of its terms. Warranties on computer hardware may become invalid for many reasons, but the most common are tampering; including removing components or opening a sealed compartment. Business terms, Programming terms, Warranty Waterfall model The waterfall model is a series of steps that can be used as design guidelines in the software development process. It conceptualizes the steps as beginning at the top level and 'flowing down' to lower levels as progress is made. Like a waterfall, progress can only flow in one direction, and the process aims to eliminate situations where retroactive changes must be made. The waterfall model has its origins in physical engineering fields like construction, in which making changes to work that has already been completed can be costly or impossible. Waterfall model steps Define and document all project requirements. Design the software architecture. Implement the design as code. Verify that the software functions as designed. Maintain the finished product. Architecture, Code, Programming terms Web development The process of creating or updating the content of web pages is referred to as web development or web dev. Whether it is to be viewed on the Internet or a local network, the content created using web development varies widely in its complexity. Tasks can range from quite basic, such as adding text and images, to the much more difficult job of creating an interactive online application (such as a game or product shopping system). Additional web development information The process of web development utilizes one or more programming languages, including C#, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Visual Basic. A person who has a career in web development is referred to as a web developer. A web developer is also expected to maintain existing web pages, and sometimes manage the security of a website. CGI, Interactive, Internet terms, Programming terms, Web WebAssembly WebAssembly, also known as Wasm or WA, is a standard developed by the W3C for creating software that runs in the web browser. Unlike JavaScript, WebAssembly is compiled software which can run at near-native speeds on your CPU. WebAssembly programs can be written in other languages, such as C, which can then be compiled to WebAssembly bytecode. WebAssembly is not meant to replace JavaScript, but to run alongside it for programs (or parts of programs) that need to run as fast as possible. WebAssembly history Development of WebAssembly began in 2015, based largely on asm.js, a JavaScript implementation of assembly language. In March 2017, the first minimum viable product was released. As of 2019, WebAssembly is supported by the current version of all major web browsers. The official WebAssembly website is webassembly.org. Languages that can compile to Wasm The following languages can compile to WebAssembly: Languages with Wasm compilers in development Compilation to Wasm is in development for the following languages: Programming terms, Web WebGL Web Graphics Library, or WebGL, is a JavaScript API that allows compatible web browsers to render 2D and 3D graphics without the assistance of a plug-in. WebGL is written in a mix of JavaScript and shader code, executed by the GPU. The Khronos Group writes and maintains WebGL. Additional WebGL information WebGL is based on OpenGL ES 2.0 and uses the HTML5 canvas element. Version 1.0 was released in March 2011 and some early adopters and users of WebGL including Google Maps and Zygote Body. Autodesk also ported many of their applications to the cloud, running on local WebGL systems. Some of the browsers that support WebGL include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. It is also supported by mobile browsers including Opera Mobile, WebOS, and Ubuntu Touch. Programming terms, Web While While may refer to any of the following: 1. A while loop or repeat loop is a loop statement in programming that performs pre-defined tasks while in the process of doing something else. For example, in Perl with code similar to the below, a while loop opens the file 'file.txt' and while going through each of the lines in the file, printing them if they contain any letters. open (INPUT, '<file.txt'); while (<INPUT>)   if ($_ =~ /[a-zA-Z /)   print '$_';     close (INPUT); Tip Like any loop, when creating a for loop make sure it condition will always be met to help prevent an endless loop. Related pages How do I create a computer program? 2. While is also a Linux command, see the while command page for further information about this command. Do, Loop, Programming terms Whole number A whole number is any number that does not contain a fraction, decimal, or negative value. For example, 1, 25, and 365 are whole numbers. Whereas the values of -3, 100.01, 365 ¼, and 2006.3 are not. In most programming languages, you can convert a number into a whole number by making it an integer. The following example shows how this could be done in Perl. The expression starts with $random, which is a variable assigned a random number. That random value is then converted into a whole number using the 'int()' function. my $random = int(rand(10)); print 'Random number between 0 and 10: $random '; Floating-point, Integer, Number, Programming terms WML WML may refer to any of the following: 1. Short for Wireless Markup Language, WML is part of the WAP standard and is an XML compliant version of HDML. 2.

In software development, a workspace is a grouping of source code files that make up a larger unit, like a web page, website, or software program. The workspace can be a file or directory. 2. In a graphical interface, a workspace is a grouping of application windows used by a window manager applications to help reduce clutter on the desktop screen. Workspaces are commonly found on Unix operating systems. 3. For software as a service, a workspace is used to describe online applications that allow users to organize and exchange files with other users over the Internet. Application window, Programming terms, Software as a Service, Software terms, Work area XML Short for extensible markup language, XML is a specification developed by W3C starting with the recommendation on February 10, 1998. XML is similar to HTML in that XML uses tags to markup a document, allowing the browser to interpret the tags and display them on a page. However, unlike HTML, XML language is unlimited (extensible). It allows tags to define themselves, and can describe the content instead of only displaying a page's content. Using XML other languages such as RSS and MathML have been created, even tools like XSLT were created using XML. Example of XML code Below is a basic example of how XML code may appear. As mentioned earlier, you can use whatever tags you want to use as long as they follow all of the rules. Also, because there is no defined rules, structure, and any tag can be placed anywhere, a DTD (document type definition) needs to be defined with instructions and structure of your XML. <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?> <computersoftware> <product> <name>Windows 8</name> <description>Microsoft Windows 8 operating system - Full version.</description> <developer>Microsoft</developer> <cost>132.78</cost> </product> <product> <name>World of Warcraft</name> <description>World of Warcraft for Mac and PC.</description> <developer>Blizzard</developer> <cost>10.99</cost> </product> </computersoftware> How do you create XML? Like HTML, XML can be created using any text editor. However, is easier to create using either an HTML editor with XML syntax highlighting like Dreamweaver or a text editor with syntax highlighting like Notepad++. Rules to remember when creating XML Although the XML language is unlimited when it comes to defining tags, there are still rules that need to be followed when writing XML code. All XML opening tags must have a matching closing tag. If you have an empty tag, you can use a tag similar to: <example/> XML tags are case sensitive, so your opening tag should exactly match the closing tag. You must have a single root tag (element) that contains all other tags. In our example, 'computersoftware' was our root tag. All tags containing an attribute must be in quotes. All tags must be properly nested. Does XML replace HTML? No. HTML is still the primary language used to create the structure of a web page. XML can be used in addition to an HTML page or as an alternative to HTML. Related pages Programming language history.

The Y combinator can be evaluated as a recursive function, which performs itself as part of its total operation. The Y combinator is an important technique in computer programming, comparable in importance to a for loop or a while loop. In lambda calculus, the Y combinator can be written as Y = λƒ.(λx.ƒ(xx)) (λx.ƒ(xx)). Curry, Haskell, Programming terms YAML YAML is a data serialization language first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001. It is used to organize and describe information, similar to other languages such as XML. It builds upon another popular data serialization format, JSON. Similar to the Python programming language, YAML uses indentation (rather than brackets or braces) to delimit blocks of data. It places emphasis on being easy for humans to read. YAML is short for YAML Ain't Markup Language. The name is meant to distinguish it from simple markup languages such as HTML. Files that contain YAML have the file extension '.yaml.' What can YAML be used for? YAML can be used for almost anything where data needs to be described in an ordered fashion. For instance: Information about users, such as username, password, and e-mail address, similar to a database. Configuration for an application, such as user settings. Describing 3D objects to be imported into applications such as Blender and Unity. Related pages Yaml.org, the official website of the YAML language. (The homepage is a valid YAML document.) Computer acronyms, Data, Programming languages, Programming terms Z-buffering Z-buffering, also known as depth buffering, is a technique in computer graphics programming that is used to determine whether an object (or part of an object) is visible in a scene. It can be implemented either in hardware or software, and is used to increase rendering efficiency. When a scene is rendered, each pixel has an X and Y coordinate (horizontal and vertical orientation to the camera), as well as a Z coordinate (depth, or distance from the camera). The Z buffer is a two-dimensional array (X and Y) which stores the Z-value of each screen pixel. If another object must be rendered at the same pixel location, the algorithm overrides the previous value if the new pixel is closer to the camera. This algorithm increases rendering speed for opaque objects, but transparent objects do not benefit since the distant objects are partially visible, and must be fully rendered. Computer graphic, Programming, Programming terms Zombie A zombie may refer to any of the following: 1. Term used to describe a process that is doing nothing but using system resources. This often occurs when a process is abandoned by a previously running program. 2. A computer that is maliciously set up to do work of another program or users. A zombie computer is often a computer or server that is compromised to help a malicious user perform a Denial of Service attack (DoS) or DDoS attack. 3.
