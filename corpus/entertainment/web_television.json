{"text": "Web television is original episodic content produced for broadcast via the Internet. The phrase \"web television\" is also sometimes used to refer to Internet television in general, which includes Internet-transmission of programs produced for both online and traditional terrestrial, cable, or satellite broadcast.\nWeb television content includes web series such as Red vs. Blue, Husbands, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, Video Game High School, Carmilla, and Teenagers, among hundreds of others; original miniseries such as Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog; animated shorts such as those of Homestar Runner; and exclusive video content that supplements conventional television broadcasts. The current major distributors of web television are Amazon, Blip.tv, Crackle, Hulu, Netflix, Newgrounds, Roku, and YouTube. Examples of web television production companies include: Generate LA-NY, Next New Networks, Revision3, and Vuguru.\nIn 2008, the International Academy of Web Television, headquartered in Los Angeles, formed in order to organize and support web television authors, actors, producers, and executives. The organization also administers the selection of winners for the Streamy Awards. In 2009, the Los Angeles Web Series Festival was founded. Several other festivals and award shows have been dedicated solely to web content, including the Indie Series Awards and the Vancouver Web Series Festival.\nIn 2013, in response to the soap opera All My Children shifting from broadcast to web television, a new category for \"Fantastic web-only series\" in the Daytime Emmy Awards was created. Later that year, Netflix made history by earning the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for web television series, for Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove, and House of Cards, at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Hulu earned the first Emmy win for Outstanding Series, for The Handmaid's Tale at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1994 to 2000 ===\nIn April 1995, Rox, a small public access program from Bloomington, Indiana, became the first series distributed via the web, with an episode titled \"Global Village Idiots\".Later the same year, New York advertising creative Scott Zakarin persuaded his employers Fattal and Collins to finance an online television drama along the lines of the contemporary television drama Melrose Place. The Spot became the first episodic fiction website, the first web soap opera. Fattal and Collins asked their Vice President, Sheri Herman, to obtain venture capital to finance it, because it was draining the resources of this boutique agency. Herman raised 7 million in a round led by Intel. She brought in advertisers including Visa and Apple to sponsor both The Spot and additional pieces through via banner ads and product placement. This was the first time advertising sponsored novel fictional content on the web. The Spot featured beautiful actors in a Santa Monica, California beach house called \u201cThe Spot\u201d. The characters authored what would be later termed blogs, with movie clips and photos of their current activities. Viewers could post to the site and email the cast to offer advice and became part of the storyline. Audience opinion was used by the writers to shift the plot-lines around.\nAccording to Zakarin, at its height the site received over 100,000 hits a day. The site earned one of the original Webby Awards, however the business was unable to generate sufficient revenue against competitors such as The East Village. Zakarin sold his interest in 1996 to investors who formed American Cybercast and was later fired. Zakarin produced another comic soap, Grape Jam, before returning to television and film (notably producing the Shatner-Nimoy dialogue Mind Meld) before returning to the Internet with Soup of the Day and Roommates. The Spot continued alongside other American Cybercast web series, notably the first sci-fi series Eon-4 and The Pyramid, until the company fell into bankruptcy in 1997.\nIn January 1999, Showtime licensed the animated sci-fi web series WhirlGirl, making it the first independently produced web series licensed by a national television network. A month later,  the series, created by David B. Williams and produced by his Visionary Media studio, premiered on Showtime in a first-ever simultaneous web/telecast. The WhirlGirl character went on to appear occasionally on Showtime, hosting a \u201cLethal Ladies\u201d programming block, for example, but spent most of her time online, appearing in 100 webisodes.In 1999, Santa Monica based Television Internet premiered the eight-minute weekly series Muscle Beach. It was a sitcom, news and fitness program in one, viewable for free with the just introduced Windows Media Player. The series lasted three seasons.\nIn 2000, The Raven started Daytona Beach Live. The station showed video about life, events, and attractions in the Daytona Beach area for up to 17,000 viewers.\n\n\n=== 2000 to 2005 ===\nAs broadband bandwidth began to increase in speed and availability, delivering high quality video over the Internet became a reality. Web Central TV, YouTube, Vimeo and DailyMotion launched their services to deliver original video. Shows such as Rocketboom appeared and post-dot-com-bust video networks such as ManiaTV!, iSTATION TV and the Ripe Digital Entertainment networks launched. In 2003, The Spot executive producer and head writer Stewart St. John revived the brand for online audiences with a new cast, and created a separate mobile series to air on Sprint PCS Vision-enabled phones. St. John and partner Todd Fisher produced over 2,500 daily videos of the first American mobile phone soap, driving story lines across platforms to the web counterpart, The Spot (2.0). By 2005, St. John-Fisher created and launched the first online half-hour scripted drama, California Heaven. In 2004-2005, Spanish producer Pedro Alonso Pablos recorded a series of video interviews featuring international well-known actors and directors like Guillermo del Toro or Keanu Reeves, plus other successful Spanish filmmakers like Santiago Segura or \u00c1lex de la Iglesia, which were distributed through his own website.\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\nIn mid-2006, several independent Web series began to achieve popularity, most notably lonelygirl15 (created by Miles Beckett, Mesh Flinders and Greg Goodfried),Soup of the Day (Zakarin and Rob Cesternino), California Heaven (St. John and Todd Fisher), \"The Burg\" (Dinosaur Diorama) and SamHas7Friends (Big Fantastic).

All series acquired audiences in the millions, led by lonelygirl15s over 100 million views during its 26-month run. The series was so successful that it secured a sponsorship deal with Neutrogena. Soup of the Day was later re-crafted and edited as a feature-length film, making it the first web series distributed on disc by distribution company Echo Bridge Entertainment. SamHas7Friends was nominated for an Emmy and temporarily removed from the Internet when it was acquired by Michael Eisner.\nMarch 2006 also saw the debut of Goodnight Burbank (created by Hayden Black) as a \"webisodic\" series.

Big Fantastic created and produced Prom Queen, which was financed and distributed by Michael Eisner's nascent online studio Vuguru, and debuted on MySpace. These web serials highlighted interactivity with the audience in addition to the narrative on relatively low budgets.\nIn contrast, the web series Sanctuary, starring actor/producer Amanda Tapping, cost $4.3 Million to produce.

Web television continued to improve in quality, rivaling network television. Online viewing was becoming less foreign to viewers and creativity flourished. Independent producers gained popularity, demonstrating that web television was a legitimate medium, and that web series would be more than a passing fad. The major networks and studios took notice of the trend, and began to debut their own original series.\nABC started the year with the comedy web series \"Squeegies,\" created by Handsome Donkey and produced by digital studio Stage 9. NBC debuted Gemini Division, a science fiction series starring Rosario Dawson, produced and created by Electric Farm Entertainment (the creators of the cult web series Afterworld).
